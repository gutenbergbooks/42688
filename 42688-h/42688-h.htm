<h1 title="">THE RED LURE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE WHITE GLEAM</h2>
<p>As Johnny Thompson bent over the black waters
of the river he thought he heard a stealthy movement
behind him. Before he could decide whether
or not his eyes had deceived him he caught the reflection
of a sudden white gleam on the dark surface
of the water. At the same time something
told him to dive, and dive he did. With the rocket-like
speed that was his, he shot straight into the
water, then away beneath the surface. He rose
some ten yards downstream. After one deep, silent
breath, he grasped a red mangrove branch for support,
then paused to listen.</p>
<p>He did not listen long, for there came a sudden
wild swirl of water close beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alligator!&rdquo; he breathed, as with a sudden and
mighty tug at the mangrove branch he threw himself
clear of the water and out upon the bank.</p>
<p>Here he paused to listen again. Catching no
sound, he began creeping back toward his first position,
the foot of the path that had been cut to the
river.</p>
<p>All this time his mind was working on double-quick
time. What had caused that sound behind him
there on the bank&mdash;man or beast? What was the
white gleam? Was it, after all, only a product of
his overwrought mind? The whole day had seemed
full of brooding menace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told himself stoutly, &ldquo;it was not all
imagination. The sound might have been&mdash;but the
white gleam? No. I saw that. After all, though,
it might have been only the reflection of a white
heron in silent flight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Night was coming on. It would soon be dark. He
did not care for that. His flashlight was in his
pocket. As he crept forward through the thick tangled
brush he seemed to feel the swift power of the
dark old river. Rio Hondo, they called it&mdash;Black
River. And black it was. Johnny had never before
seen water that could so perfectly reproduce the
black gleam of polish ebony. And yet, somehow,
he had come to think of the river as his friend. That
was how he came to be there now. Pant, his pal,
was away. The thirty black and brown faces about
camp had seemed singularly strange and unfriendly,
so he had come to the river for comfort. And now,
how had it repaid him? Had it in that white gleam
given him a friendly warning, or had it tricked him
into a place of great peril, into danger of being eaten
by an alligator?</p>
<p>Suddenly his thoughts came to an end. Sooner
than he expected he broke through the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; into
the path. Starting back, he stared for a second in
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one here,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;But wait;
some one has been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In astonishment he picked up a long-bladed, gleaming
knife. It was a machete, the tool and weapon
of the bushman of Central America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like Petillo&rsquo;s machete,&rdquo; he breathed. What
could it mean?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Just then he caught a sudden sound from the
water. It was like a startled cry for help. He
thought he caught sight of a head above the black
waters. He might have been mistaken. It was
growing dark. He drew his flashlight from his
pocket. It was water-logged, short circuited, useless.</p>
<p>Again came the strange cry and at the same time
a great swirl of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The alligator!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>For an instant he thought of throwing himself
in the water to go to the rescue. This he knew was
madness. There were other alligators. Grim, terrible,
man-eating beasts were these sharp nosed alligators
of British Honduras, Central America.</p>
<p>So, as he sat there, crowded well back in the
bushes, silent, motionless, listening and thinking,
darkness came and blotted out all, both good and
bad, that might have been seen upon the surface of
the Rio Hondo.</p>
<p>A deep feeling of foreboding and gloom settled
down upon him as darkness hid the river.</p>
<p>Picking up the machete that lay at his feet, he
felt of its edge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keen as a razor,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Did some
one try to kill me with it? If so, I wonder why?
Well, he didn&rsquo;t, and won&rsquo;t. Providence took a hand.
Must have lost his balance and fallen in. Bad
swimmer. Current carried him out and a &rsquo;gator got
him. That&rsquo;s the way it looks. Can&rsquo;t tell, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuddered at the thought; the &rsquo;gator might
have gotten him, too.</p>
<p>Johnny was in a strange land, the strangest he
had ever seen. In other days, as you will know if
you have read our other stories of the adventures of
Johnny Thompson, fate had led him over the frozen
trails of Alaska, down the timber roads of the Cascades
and out over the sea. Now here he was far
up a tropical river, in the heart of the &ldquo;bush,&rdquo; alone.</p>
<p>It is not pleasant to be alone in a tropical jungle
at night. Johnny rose to go. His flashlight gone,
there was nothing left but to grope his way back over
the machete-hewn trail to camp. It was some distance&mdash;all
of a mile.</p>
<p>As he took his first step, off to the right a twig
snapped. His heart skipped a beat and his face felt
strangely cold. Had he been watched? Now the
creature was going on before him. Was it a man,
or a jaguar? (Natives called them tigers.) He
preferred the word &ldquo;tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Gripping the keen edged machete, he struck away
straight down the trail.</p>
<p>There came no further sound. Slowly, steadily,
he advanced. Half the distance was covered. He
was breathing more easily when a sudden hoarse
sound brought him to a stand.</p>
<p>Then he laughed. Off to the right he caught the
gleam of two small red balls of fire. And again
that hoarse bark broke the silence of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Gator,&rdquo; he said with a chuckle. &ldquo;Forgot there
was one in a pool over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not laugh five minutes later as he heard,
off to the left, the pu-pu-pu of a jaguar. These great
cats were dangerous. They had been known to kill
a horse and swim a river with the carcass. The
golden balls that now peered at him from the first
branch of a great Santa Maria tree were not
reassuring.</p>
<p>Redoubling his pace, he hurried on toward camp.
Five minutes later, with a sigh of satisfaction, he
broke through the brush into a clearing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Here he paused in astonishment. The place was
silent, more silent than he had known it even in the
dead of night. The gleam of coals on the cooking
platform and the dim bulk of cabins looming in the
dark were the only signs that men lived here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>To his utter bewilderment there came no answer.</p>
<p>An hour before he had left thirty men here. Now
there was not one. What could it mean? Again
cold dread gripped his heart.</p>
<p>Turning, he hurried down a logging road to the
edge of a broad creek. There the white bulk of a
large flat-bottomed boat greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t take the <i>Maria Theresa</i>, anyway.&rdquo;
There was a comfort in that. &ldquo;Fellow&rsquo;d sure be
up against it a hundred miles from the coast without
a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he thought this, his ears caught the steady
dip-dip of pit-pan paddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Hello there!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>Again there came no answer. Even the paddles,
if paddles there had been, were silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>He turned and walked slowly back to camp. There
he groped about until he had found a bench. This
he leaned against the side of a cabin, and burying
his back in the soft cohune nut thatch, pressed his
brow with both hands in an endeavor to think sanely
and clearly.</p>
<p>Time passed. The coals on the cooking platform
growing dimmer and dimmer, at last blinked out. The
darkness appeared to grow more intense, the night
more silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said it couldn&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; he muttered at
last, &ldquo;and perhaps it can&rsquo;t. But there was the red
lure. The red lure,&rdquo; he repeated softly.</p>
<p>The red lure! He had heard of it first in a little
cabinetmaker&rsquo;s shop in Chicago. In that shop an
old man wrought wonders with precious woods&mdash;rosewood
and ebony and mahogany. Strange tales this
old man had to tell, and he told them as he worked.
Tales they were of tropical isles, of green rivers and
dense forests.</p>
<p>One day as he put the last touch to a bit of wood
that gleamed red as a western sunset, he had exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The red lure, Johnny! The red lure! That&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s beckoned men on, and times enough to their
death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after laying the bit of wood down as gently
as if it had been a priceless porcelain top, he had
added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Johnny, I know where the lure ends. Far
up a tropical river, a big black river. It&rsquo;s there,
Johnny, and unscarred by the hand of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Awed by the old man&rsquo;s tones, Johnny
had whispered the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Johnny.&rdquo; The old man had half closed
his eyes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the owner of that land would
like to know. Three times he has sent men in boats
up the Rio Hondo. Three times they came back empty
handed; that is, the ones that came back at all. Why?
Who knows. Who can solve all the mysteries of the
tropics? Who can guess the trickery and intrigue
that lies hidden in a Spaniard&rsquo;s mind? The red lure
is still there. Men have died for it; but there it stands.
The red lure, Johnny. The red lure!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>He had turned once more to his work, but Johnny
had not forgotten. Something within him had been
stirred to the depths. He had heard the call of the
wilderness, had felt the challenge of the impossible.</p>
<p>In time, having sought out his partner of many
adventures, &ldquo;Panther Eye,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pant&rdquo; as he was
called, he had gone in search of the owner of the red
lure. He had found him to be a rich business man.</p>
<p>At first this capitalist, Roderick Grayson, had
merely laughed at the proposition which the two boys
made&mdash;that they be given a try at the red lure. In
time he had come to take them more seriously.</p>
<p>At last he had made them a proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of having you about,&rdquo; he growled good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. You go to
Belize, the Capitol of Honduras. That&rsquo;s a city of
twelve thousand. Plenty of men and boats there. I&rsquo;ll
instruct my agent there to furnish you with motor
boats and pay for thirty men. You may have them
a hundred days, not a day more. At the end of that
time you must show me a profit from your expedition
or you lose this concession. Is that plain? And
satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>The rich man had bowed them out, and that is how
it happened that on this particular night Johnny was
far up the Rio Hondo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now this!&rdquo; Johnny said to himself. &ldquo;A
bolt out of the blue! An apparent attempt at my life.
My men vanish. What is to be the end of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he realized that he was alone in the dark;
that perils lurked in every corner of the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well enough to have some sort of light,&rdquo; he told
himself.</p>
<p>There was a flashlight on a beam in the very cabin
against which his bench rested. To secure that and
to try it out by a flash on the floor was but the work
of a moment.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the bench he felt a little more
secure. As he sat down his foot struck something
and sent it to the ground with a thud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The machete,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Picking it up, he examined it curiously. On the
horn handle of this bushman&rsquo;s sword he discovered
the initials, S. P.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seperino Petillo,&rdquo; he said with a start. &ldquo;So it
was Petillo. I was not mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>His mind was in a whirl. Petillo, a half-caste
Spaniard, had been his foreman. Surely, this was a
strange land. The very man to whom he had given
position and standing among his people had, apparently,
tried to kill him.</p>
<p>For some time he sat there thinking and his
thoughts were long, long thoughts.</p>
<p>The red lure was all about him. The smell of it
was in his nostrils.</p>
<p>Yet, less than a third of their work was done.
To establish a camp, to build cabins from the trunks
and leaves of the cohune nut tree, to cut paths and
roads, all this had taken time. A few weeks more
and they would have been drifting silently downstream
with their red treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now this has happened!&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>And yet, what had happened? He could not tell&mdash;could
only guess.</p>
<p>Hearing a sound to the right, he turned to listen.
Catching it again, he threw his powerful flashlight
on the spot.</p>
<p>To his astonishment the light fell full upon the
face and figure of a girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>She was a short, brown-eyed, bare-footed, Spanish
girl, about sixteen years of age. Too startled to move,
she stood there for an instant, blinking in the light.
Then she turned and fled down the path.</p>
<p>Too much surprised to follow at once, Johnny sat
in his place, wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not such a girl within fifty miles. I am
sure of that,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Must have come over
from Quintanaroo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond the Rio Hondo lay Quintanaroo, a land of
many mysteries.</p>
<p>Rising, he followed down the path to the creek&rsquo;s
edge. There he sent the gleam of his flashlight shooting
down the creek. He was just in time to see a
slender canoe disappear round a clump of red mangrove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where she came from,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>As he turned to retrace his steps he caught the long
drawn, hoarse call of a jaguar. There were empty,
palm thatched cottages up the river. Rumors were
afloat of a man-eating &ldquo;tiger&rdquo; who had carried away
the former owners of these cabins. Could it be that
he had been mistaken about the plot? Had he misjudged
the action of the unfortunate one at the river
bank? Had his men become frightened by tales of
the man-eater, and fled? Who could tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;morning will come, and
with it the light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />SUDDEN CATASTROPHE</h2>
<p>As if loath to disturb the perfect silence of a night,
dawn lingers in the tropical jungle. Off somewhere in
the distance a wild parrot screams; nearer at hand
a long tailed tropical black-bird begins for the thousandth
time to practice the song he will never learn.
Swinging from limb to limb, a monkey chatters at a
snake. Faint and from far away, like a young puppy
calling for his breakfast, an alligator barks. Trunks
of trees, gray bulks of cabins, green clusters of ferns
take shape and then, with a sudden burst of light, day
arrives.</p>
<p>The sound that awakened Johnny Thompson to
dull reality of a hapless yesterday was the braying
of a burro. He had remained seated on his bench all
night. At first he had not dared to sleep. At last,
overcome by fatigue, he had fallen asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>At first, only half awake, he imagined himself in
Belize. Burros were common enough there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he declared, shaking himself, &ldquo;I am not
in Belize. This is the jungle. There are no burros.
I was dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping to his feet, he shook himself free of the
last vestige of sleep.</p>
<p>As if to deny his last assertion, there struck his
ears, clear and defiant, a loud, laughing &ldquo;He-haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be a donkey myself!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
turning and racing down the path that led to the
creek. The sound appeared to come from there.</p>
<p>When he had covered two-thirds of the distance, he
paused in astonishment. Before him in the path was
the skinniest, boniest, most dilapidated and dejected
specimen of animal kind it had ever been his privilege
to meet. Yet, it was unmistakably a burro.</p>
<p>At that moment, as if to proclaim his species, the
creature stuck his nose in the air and brayed once
again.</p>
<p>In spite of his great dilemma, Johnny sat down on
a fallen mahogany tree trunk and rocked with
laughter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; he exclaimed, his fit of laughter over,
&ldquo;where did you come from, and how? Did you
walk or swim, or both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without an attempt at an answer, the creature
paused in the path, hung his head and put on such a
droll and mournful look as set the boy off into another
fit of laughter.</p>
<p>Johnny was once more regaining control of himself
when he caught a yellow gleam through the
branches. The next moment a huge bunch of
bananas appeared, and beneath them was Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, meet my new friend Rip Van Winkle,&rdquo;
smiled Pant. &ldquo;Call him Rip for short. He&rsquo;s just
slept twenty years down there by a deserted cabin.
I woke him up and brought him along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity! Why didn&rsquo;t you let him sleep?&rdquo;
grinned Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I? He was bound to wake up
sooner or later. He&rsquo;d been lonesome if there&rsquo;d been
no one around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But honest, Johnny,&rdquo; Pant&rsquo;s tone became serious,
&ldquo;what would you think of a native who would leave
a poor old fellow like that to starve!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d think he was a pig of a dog. But how much
better can we do? What&rsquo;ll we feed him on?
Bananas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy. There&rsquo;s a tree up here that raises grass
on its branches instead of leaves&mdash;bread-nut tree, they
call it. I saw one up the river two days ago. Burros
and cattle get fat on it. We&rsquo;ll get a native to climb
a few trees and gather a ton of this hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Natives?&rdquo; said Johnny slowly. &ldquo;That reminds
me&mdash;there aren&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant, setting down his bananas
so suddenly that many of them broke from the stem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skipped. Vamoosed. All gone.&rdquo; Johnny threw
out his arms in a wide gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You tell me. All
I know is they&rsquo;re gone. They told us in New Orleans
that this red lure was a hoodoo. They told us the
same thing in Belize. Maybe it is. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Pant sprang to his feet. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to
Belize and get another crew!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if they leave us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a thousand men in Belize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant,&rdquo; said Johnny slowly, &ldquo;I think one of them
tried to kill me. I&mdash;I think it was Petillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny seated himself on a log and told of his
night&rsquo;s experiences, from his narrow escape on the
bank and in the river to his discovery of the mysterious
Spanish girl in the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo; he asked at the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there&rsquo;s that man-eating jaguar they&rsquo;ve
been talking about. They may have run away because
they were afraid. They may have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of that fellow down by the river!&rdquo; exclaimed
Pant. &ldquo;No! I tell you what, Johnny, someone
is plotting against us, someone with money and
power. We&rsquo;ll not spend a night here alone. We&rsquo;ll
get right back to Belize. And we must not come
back unless we find a real, fearless crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that last is a big contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so. But let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s not impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with that?&rdquo; said Johnny, pointing
to the burro.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take him along in the power boat. I tell you
what, Johnny, I always feel lucky when I&rsquo;m saving
some poor dumb creature from suffering. I shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if Rip would do us a mighty good turn sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this Pant was more nearly right than he knew.
Also, this sad-looking quadruped was destined to be
the cause of bringing him into great peril. But that
was all in the future.</p>
<p>Pant had been down the river in a dory for bananas,
cocoanuts and casabas. As soon as they had unloaded
these stores and had eaten a hasty breakfast, they
turned the prow of their motor-boat downstream and
went pop-popping away.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Belize, the city to which the boys returned, is one
of matchless beauty. Built on a point of land reaching
out into the sea, with its red-roofed, white-walled
houses, gnarled old mahogany trees by its governor&rsquo;s
palace and stately royal palms at the back of the
Bishop&rsquo;s house, bathed in the tropical sun, it is a city
to dream of.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson dreamed of it very little. His
mind was occupied with but one thought&mdash;getting
back to the red lure.</p>
<p>He was making his way up from the dock to the
hotel when someone called his name. Turning, he
saw Hardgrave. Hardgrave was an old man. He
hailed from the States and had been twenty-five
years in the tropics. A natural student, he had
learned much in that time and had already been of
service to this boy from the land of his birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back so soon!&rdquo; he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did get back rather soon,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;At
least our crew did. But we&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo; He said
this last in such a tone as Sheridan must have used
when he said: &ldquo;Turn, boys, turn; we&rsquo;re going back.&rdquo;
He had been given a task to do, and like any red-blooded
American boy, he meant to go through
with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to tell me about it?&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over to the hotel yard. We&rsquo;ll find shade
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, beneath a low-spreading cocoanut palm,
Johnny told his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the old man impressively, when
the boy had finished his story, &ldquo;get up from your
chair and walk over to the cooler for a drink of water.
As you come back, without appearing interested, look
at the man over there in the far corner of the
veranda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three minutes later Johnny resumed his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See him?&rdquo; the old man leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw two men; a tall, thin, dark-skinned one, and
a heavy-set one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thin one, a half-caste Spaniard, is the one.
That&rsquo;s Daego.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daego? Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible you have not heard of him?&rdquo; Hardgrave
asked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the richest, most unscrupulous
man of our city. He bought you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bought us out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hired your men to quit, and to attempt killing
you, like as not. He&rsquo;d do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but why?&rdquo; Johnny licked his dry lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He has his eye on that red lure of yours, has
had for a long time. Strange you haven&rsquo;t heard of
him, haven&rsquo;t seen his boats. But then, of course, they
pass in the night. Black boats, they are. You don&rsquo;t
see much of them. You wouldn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d bet on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny wanted to ask about those boats, but he
wanted still more to learn of Daego&rsquo;s desire for his
treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Hardgrave, &ldquo;Daego&rsquo;s built up an
immense fortune working the Rio Hondo territory.
He&rsquo;s worked all the land up to your tract. There
he was obliged to stop. It was owned by a man who
would not sell; at least not at his beggar&rsquo;s price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know, British Honduras is one side of
the Rio Hondo, and Quintanaroo, a state of Mexico,
on the other. Daego went across the river and obtained
concessions in Quintanaroo. He&rsquo;s working
there now. His camp can&rsquo;t be a dozen miles from
your own. I&rsquo;m surprised that you haven&rsquo;t seen his
boats but of course you wouldn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re black, and
mostly pass by night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man paused as if in thought. Then, of a
sudden, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Caribs you want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Carib?&rdquo; Johnny asked. &ldquo;Some sort of
native fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled Hardgrave, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re men. Real men,
too. Indians. Columbus called them the sturdiest,
most warlike men of America. They&rsquo;ve been that ever
since. They&rsquo;ve mixed with the whites and the blacks,
but they&rsquo;ve never lost their language nor their courage,
either. They are supposed to have been head-hunters
at one time or another, though that can&rsquo;t be proven.
They&rsquo;re the bravest sailors, the most daring hunters
of our coast; the best workers, too, and if they enter
into a contract they&rsquo;re mighty likely to go through
with it. What&rsquo;s more, they hate Daego. He&rsquo;s cheated
and underpaid them. There&rsquo;s not one that will work
for him. Yes, you want Caribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And son,&rdquo; the man leaned forward eagerly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re in luck for once! There&rsquo;s two boat loads
of them over from Stann Creek now. You&rsquo;d better
see them. They&rsquo;ll be down at the storeroom of the
Tidewater Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go see them,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
best time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along about sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>They parted at the gate. Johnny went to the market
and bought the ham of a young peccary (wild
pig) and took it to the hotel to be baked for a late
supper. After that he sat for a full hour under the
shade of a cohune-nut tree, thinking&mdash;thinking hard
about many things, of the little brown girl who had
appeared in the path by his camp in the night, and
of Daego&rsquo;s dark boats that passed in the night.</p>
<p>Just at dusk Johnny met Hardgrave at the bridge,
and together they walked in silence toward the Tidewater
storeroom.</p>
<p>As they approached the door they caught the sound
of laughter. To Johnny&rsquo;s well-trained ears there
came old familiar sounds, a quick shuffle of feet, the
slap-slap of leather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boxing,&rdquo; he told himself. His pulse quickened
at the thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson, young and vigorous, belonged
to that ever-increasing army of American boys who
realize that no person can fight his best in the battle
of life unless he is physically fit. A strong swimmer,
fast on his feet and limber as a hickory limb,
Johnny was not the least skillful of boxers. So his
heart was made glad by the sound that greeted his
ears.</p>
<p>Silently he and Hardgrave entered the long low
room to join the little company of watchers.</p>
<p>The instant Johnny&rsquo;s eyes fell upon the dark,
gleaming, strong and well-moulded forms of the
Caribs, he felt himself admiring them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black faces,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;but real men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that big fellow over in the corner,&rdquo; whispered
Hardgrave, &ldquo;the one with the sprinkle of
gray in his hair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tivoli, the chief Carib of them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later Johnny Thompson found himself
facing this chief and champion of the Caribs.
How had it come about? Why ask? When two
devotees of an art meet, how long a time passes before
they begin displaying their skill?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>That he was facing no mean boxer, Johnny realized
quite well. He had seen Tivoli in a sparring
match with one of his own men. Tivoli thought of
this bout with a white boy, who could easily have
walked under his arm, as something of a joke. This
was shown quite plainly by the smile that overspread
his face as he seized Johnny&rsquo;s hand in a friendly grasp.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, he had two purposes in entering
the match. He wished to promote friendly relations
with the Caribs and he wished to prove to Tivoli that,
though still a boy, he was possessed of such physical
prowess as even a grown man might respect.</p>
<p>So the match began. That the Caribs took more
than a passing interest in the affair was shown by the
hush that fell upon the place as the first swinging
blows fanned the air. Even the river that swept by
the wide open port-side door seemed strangely silent.</p>
<p>The shadows, cast by the single small lamp, were
deceiving. Twice, in stepping back from the whirling
arms of his giant opponent, Johnny barely missed a
blow that, however well meant, would have sent him
to a land of wild dreams.</p>
<p>Though much smaller than his opponent, Johnny
was quick on his feet. This, combined with the clock-like
working of his trained mind, made him quite a
match for the Carib.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Across the shining mahogany floor, back again,
criss-cross, to right, to left, they battled. The Carib
drove the white boy into a corner. Johnny feinted
with his left, dodged to the right, and was free.</p>
<p>Crouching low, Tivoli sprang square at him, but
he was gone. Not so soon, however, but that he left a
sting on the giant&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Grinning still, Tivoli squared away for a second
rush. This time he approached more cautiously and
won applause by a neatly placed blow on Johnny&rsquo;s
left cheek.</p>
<p>The contestants warmed to the sport. Caribs
know nothing of rounds and breathing spells. The
contest goes to the man of greatest skill and longest
endurance.</p>
<p>They had battled royally for ten minutes. Johnny
felt the warm ring of approval in the cheers of the
Caribs as he scored a point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Then, swift as the wind, came the end. Since
his opponent was so much taller than he, Johnny was
often obliged to leap off the floor to so much as score
a light tap on Tivoli&rsquo;s chin. In the wild excitement
of the contest he had perhaps grown a trifle reckless.
Intent upon winning one more point, Johnny
leaped a full foot from the floor and aimed a swift
blow at his opponent&rsquo;s chin. The Carib, with a sudden
quick movement, bent low for a blow at his chest.</p>
<p>The impact of Johnny&rsquo;s gloved fist with the
giant&rsquo;s chin was startlingly quick and sure. The report
was like a muffled explosion. Tivoli&rsquo;s hands
shot out and up, then he crumpled down like an
empty sack.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s head was in a whirl. An instant of
time, one unfortunate move had undone all. At least,
so he thought as, throwing his gloves from his hands,
he bent over the prostrate Carib.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />MYSTERIOUS SOUNDS</h2>
<p>It was a down-hearted Johnny who bent over the
fallen Carib champion and strove as best he could to
bring him back to consciousness. He had hoped much.
His interview with this man was to pave the way
to certain success. With this fearless chief as the
leader of his men, with a faithful Carib band behind
him, he was to have gone triumphantly back up Rio
Hondo and, in spite of perils that lurk in the jungle,
in spite of unscrupulous Daego&rsquo;s trickery and cunning,
was to have brought back the richest treasure
that had ever floated upon the ebony waters of the
Black River. And now it had come to this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>What would the man do, once he was brought back
from the world of strange dreams where Johnny&rsquo;s
unintended and unfortunate blow had sent him.
Johnny&rsquo;s heart skipped a beat at the thought. He
might be obliged to flee for his life. He had heard
wild stories of these primitive people of Honduras;
how, when slightly wounded in play with machetes,
a man flew into a rage and at a single blow severed
the offender&rsquo;s head from his body. These were simple
people, men of the tropics, quick in love and sudden
in hate.</p>
<p>Since there was no answer to this, Johnny could
but fan his victim and await results.</p>
<p>He did not wait long. The man&rsquo;s eyes opened
and he sat up unsteadily, staring wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who did that?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who&mdash;hi&mdash;hit
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unc-a,&rdquo; the men grunted, pointing at Johnny.</p>
<p>Johnny put on as brave and friendly a face as he
could command. Though friendly enough, it was far
from brave. His heart was in his toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; the chief looked incredulous, &ldquo;you hit
me like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded. He dared not trust his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! You&mdash;you little hammer!&rdquo; exclaimed
the chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>At that there was a roaring burst of laughter.
From that day on Johnny was known among the
Caribs as &ldquo;Little Hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tivoli joined heartily in the laugh and as it subsided,
to Johnny&rsquo;s great surprise and joy, he
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want men? I got men. All the men you
want. How many men, you think? Sixty men?
Half work, half watch and fight? What you think?
All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this sudden turn of fortune&rsquo;s wheel, Johnny&rsquo;s
head was too much in a whirl to permit of much
clear thinking. He merely nodded. Then, seized by
a sudden inspiration, he invited Tivoli to join him in
his feast of roast peccary&mdash;an invitation which was
promptly accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardgrave,&rdquo; said Johnny, as the two sat in the
hotel court after the feast and Tivoli&rsquo;s departure, &ldquo;do
these creatures, these jaguars which the natives call
&lsquo;tigers,&rsquo; ever become man-eaters?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Once in a blue moon they do. I knew of one
that did. That was on the island of Riotan. And,
by the way, it was only a month ago that an Englishman,
a chicle buyer, told me of actually seeing one
stalking a man&mdash;up the Rio Hondo, too. By all
that&rsquo;s good! Right up in your country! It must
have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny leaned forward in unconcealed interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This &lsquo;man-eater&rsquo; as they call him,&rdquo; Hardgrave
continued, &ldquo;has a bad reputation. You&rsquo;ll see little
settlements, two or three palm thatched cabins along
the river, deserted because of him. That&rsquo;s what the
chicle buyer said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead? The people dead?&rdquo; the words stuck in
Johnny&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. The jaguar might have carried off
a child, or even a man. Those cats can kill an ox.
They&rsquo;re bad when they get old. And this tiger is
old, fairly gray bearded, the chicle buyer said. Said
it made his blood run cold to see him stalking that
native. Of course he was armed; all those Englishmen
go armed. Only a pistol, but enough to scare
that spotted fury away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Just as I shot,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what he told me, &lsquo;the creature
turned its head and I saw its marking. I had
heard of it before. There was a broad white stripe
above the left eye. Someone had creased him with
a bullet years before. Pity it hadn&rsquo;t killed him. Didn&rsquo;t,
though.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Hardgrave paused to look away at the moon that
was just rising above the cocoanut palms in the
churchyard across the way. Wind stirred the branches
noisily. Johnny started. The story of that &ldquo;tiger&rdquo;
had affected his imagination strangely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll know if you see him,&rdquo; Hardgrave concluded
dryly. &ldquo;A white strip above his left ear. Guess
I&rsquo;ll turn in. You&rsquo;re leaving before dawn? Here&rsquo;s
luck!&rdquo; He pressed the boy&rsquo;s hand, and was gone.</p>
<p>It was a brave company that Johnny assembled at
the postoffice dock next day&mdash;sixty Caribs, all from
Stann Creek. There had been no need that these
men go home for luggage. All that they had was on
their boats. It was little enough, too. The two most
important items were the great long-bladed machetes
that hung at their belts and the cooking platforms on
the decks of their sailing crafts.</p>
<p>To the mouth of the Rio Hondo they would sail.
After that Johnny would give them a tow up the
river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Pant was in great spirits. He had lived much in
the jungles of India. There he had met the great yellow
tiger and the treacherous black leopard. He had
heard of the &ldquo;man-eater&rdquo; up the river and was more
than eager to hunt out his lair and do him battle. Of
course his days belonged to Johnny, but nights were
his own, and night is when the big cats prowl.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, as they went gliding up the dark
river he thought of many things&mdash;of the red lure
and of his hopes to win with this new and more
trustworthy crew. He thought again of the mysterious
brown girl who had appeared in the trail on that
memorable night spent alone in camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may belong to the company of that rascal
Daego,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I doubt it, though. Her
face was too honest and frank for that. I wonder
who she may be, and if she will return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered if their camp had been destroyed
by their enemies, and thought of Daego&rsquo;s black boats
which Hardgrave had spoken of, and the trouble
Daego was in which made him want to move back
across the river. He wondered if the trouble was
in any way connected with the black boats. He even
gave a passing thought to Rip, the burro, who under
Pant&rsquo;s care had learned to prick up his ears with
an air of importance and had actually taken on a
little flesh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t bring any feed for him,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Pant will have to hunt out one of those bread-nut
trees and gather some grass from it. Be an interesting
experience, mowing grass from the top of the
forest. Like cutting a giant&rsquo;s hair,&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>So they moved on up the river. Past the last
banana plantation and cocoanut grove, through thin
settlements of bushmen, between groves of cohune-nut
trees, and on and on, up and up until night fell
and the stars came out.</p>
<p>Coming to the mouth of a small stream, they decided
to camp for the night. Boats were tied to
overhanging mangrove branches, dry wood was gathered
and soon fires gleamed out brightly. Mingled
with the crackle of the blaze was the merry talk and
laughter of these ever cheerful people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>While supper was being prepared, Pant shoved a
dug-out from the deck of his power boat and went
paddling away up the small stream. He was going
on a little trip of exploration all his own. Not that
he expected to find anything of real interest. It was
too dark for that. He wanted to be alone for a time,
and besides, there is a real thrill to be had from poking
the nose of your canoe straight away in the night up
a stream you have never seen.</p>
<p>As he moved slowly forward into the dark, the
silent mystery of the night was now and then broken
by the splash of an alligator as he took to the water.
Nothing was to be feared from these so long as his
canoe remained in upright position.</p>
<p>On and on he glided. The light of cooking fires
faded. Laughter died away. Still he glided on.
Then, of a sudden, he became conscious of a new
sound&mdash;a throbbing that, beating faintly against his
eardrums, seemed to come from nowhere. At first
he thought it was the beating of his own heart and
wondered at his increased power to hear in that
silence. Soon enough he knew it was not that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; he asked himself as he held his
dripping paddle in mid-air to listen.</p>
<p>Getting no satisfactory answer, he drove his paddle
into the water and sent his boat forward at renewed
speed. This lasted for ten minutes. Perspiration
ran down his cheeks as he paused to listen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, there it is, louder!&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Much louder. It&rsquo;s up the river. It&rsquo;s a gasoline
motor&mdash;a motor-boat. No, it can&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping his paddle straight down, he touched bottom
at eighteen inches. In such a stream there were
sunken logs. No motor-boat could ascend to the spot
where the motor was throbbing.</p>
<p>Swinging his boat about, he drove its prow
against the shelving bank. Leaping ashore, he bent
over, and putting his ear to the ground, listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and yet it is! It&rsquo;s
a stationary gasoline engine going full swing up that
creek. And what&rsquo;s more&rdquo;&mdash;his thoughts were working
rapidly now&mdash;&ldquo;this creek runs up into our property.
That engine is on our land. What can they
be doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Creeping back into his canoe he allowed it to drift
downstream. He wanted to go up and investigate,
but it was too late. What that engine could be doing
up there he could not so much as guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll find out,&rdquo; he told himself stoutly. &ldquo;Leave
it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />TREE HAY AND A JAGUAR</h2>
<p>Aside from slight damage done by a band of wild
pigs, who in their search for food had rooted their
way into the cook shack, the camp up the Rio Hondo
was just as the boys had left it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite evident,&rdquo; said Pant with a grin, &ldquo;that
Daego, or whoever it was that brought our work here
to an end, thought there was time enough to come
over and take possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect us back, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here we go to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to work with a will. Two days&rsquo; time
saw a bigger and better camp erected, new roads cut
into the jungle and everything in readiness for
operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>It was early in the afternoon of this day that
Johnny saw a small dugout, paddled by two Spaniards,
moving up the creek.</p>
<p>Surprised at their appearing on these little frequented
waters, he paused at the entrance of the trail
to see them pass.</p>
<p>They did not pass, but, pulling up to the landing,
tied their boat and got out.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Johnny stepped from the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon,&rdquo; said the taller of the two. &ldquo;We are
looking for Johnny Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Johnny Thompson,&rdquo; said Johnny, not a
little surprised that any stranger should be looking
for him at this lonely spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message for you.&rdquo; The man bowed low as
he held out a sealed envelope.</p>
<p>With fingers that trembled ever so slightly, Johnny
tore this open and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p><i>To Johnny Thompson.</i></p>
<p><i>Sir:</i></p>
<p><i>It would give me the greatest of pleasure to
have your most entertaining and entirely fascinating
presence at a dinner to be served at my
camp a few miles above your own, at six this
evening. We have had the great good fortune
to secure two wild turkeys and your assistance
in eating them would be both a service and a
pleasure to me.</i></p>
<p><i>Your Most Humble Servant and, I trust, Friend,</i></p>
<p class="jr1"><i>El Vincia Daego.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a moment Johnny stared at the note. He
wanted to laugh, but did not quite dare. He was
tempted to use some very strong language, but refrained
from that, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he came up here ahead of me and is now at
his camp,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;He invites me
to a feed of wild turkey. I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later he was showing the note to Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go, of course,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you? He might get rough&mdash;or
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good reason for going. Can&rsquo;t afford
to show a white feather, can I? If I excuse myself,
it&rsquo;s equivalent to saying: &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t come.
I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going into a strange country, Mexico,
without a passport,&rdquo; Pant protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a passport in a wilderness? Why, if it
wasn&rsquo;t for this gloomy old river they wouldn&rsquo;t know
where the boundary runs. There are hundreds of
miles of unsurveyed and unexplored boundary lines
down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take a bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a dugout and a paddle. What do you
think this is? Cannibal land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Pant, a trifle grimly, &ldquo;good luck,
and may you come back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back, right enough,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>Had he known what was to come from this turkey
dinner, would he have gone? He might, and then
again he might have stayed on his own side of Rio
Hondo. Who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re going out to dinner,&rdquo; said Pant, as
Johnny prepared to take the trail to the river, &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll go on a hunt for a bread-nut tree that grows
grass for leaves. That old burro, Rip, is showing
signs of being hungry. I caught him trying to chew
the picture from the side of an empty corn can this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>True to his word, just as dusk was falling, Pant
found himself paddling slowly down the river. Suddenly,
as his keen eyes followed the outline of the
forest that crowded the river bank, he caught sight
of a tree that towered above its fellows. From the
tip of its branches hung great masses of green hay.
Reaching down a yard, two yards, even three, it looked
like long green streamers hung out for a St. Patrick&rsquo;s
Day celebration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bread-nut tree,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>On reaching the tree he found himself presented
with a serious problem. The trunk of the tree was
immense; the first limb twenty feet up. At first
sight he felt himself defeated. But on circling the
tree he discovered a stout vine which reached far above
the first branch.</p>
<p>Soon, with his machete still swinging at his side,
he was going up hand over hand.</p>
<p>Scorning the first branch, where the grass clumps
were small and ragged, he climbed to the second,
then to the third, fully thirty feet above the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be careful,&rdquo; he warned himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Many a man had been killed by a fall from these
trees. To gather the grass one must climb far out
on a slender limb and hack off the end which holds
the heavy clump. Suddenly released from its load,
the limb springs up and if the grass gatherer loses his
hold he is unseated and down he plunges to injury
or death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be cautious,&rdquo; Pant told himself. Had
he but known it, no amount of caution could save him
from facing the peril just before him.</p>
<p>Carefully he climbed over the stouter part of the
limb, then out and still out on a slender branch from
whose tip there hung a clump of &ldquo;grass&rdquo; that seemed
as large as a haycock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days&rsquo; feed for old Rip from a single
clump,&rdquo; he told himself as, gripping the branch firmly
with one hand, he drew his machete from its sheath.</p>
<p>He had lifted the machete for the first hack when
his action was arrested by a slight scratching sound
coming from somewhere above him. Imagine his surprise
and horror when, upon looking up, he caught
the gleam of two yellow eyes and at the same time
heard the thumping lash of a great cat&rsquo;s tail. It was
a jaguar about to spring!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Pant was so startled that he all but lost his hold
upon the limb. Overpowered by something akin to
fear, for the instant he was unable to move. He
was not so far bereft of his senses as to fail to note
that above the creature&rsquo;s left eye was a broad white
stripe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the killer!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>To do two things at once; to listen and talk intelligently,
and to employ one&rsquo;s mind with planning
safe escape requires a steady nerve and active mind.
Johnny Thompson was doing that very thing. He
was talking in an intelligent and connected manner
to Daego, the Spanish half-caste millionaire of British
Honduras. They had been talking for some time
about many things that had to do with industries on
the Rio Hondo, and all the time their discussion had
become more animated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Johnny was seated before a small table. Daego sat
opposite him. On the table was a pile of bills. A
gentle breeze, entering the hut through its lattice-like
walls of cohune-nut stems, fluttered the corners
of the bills. They were big bills&mdash;fifties and hundreds.
There was in that carelessly flung pile over
twenty thousand dollars. Although one may not feel
at liberty to refuse to attend a wild turkey dinner,
he may refuse to accept other things, even at the hand
of a millionaire. Johnny was refusing, refusing in
the most vigorous language, and at the same time his
keen eyes were taking in the construction of the hut
and his mind plotting swift and sudden exit.</p>
<p>He smiled involuntarily at thought of it. The
smile, without a meaning as far as the half-caste millionaire,
Daego, was concerned, angered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offer you a fortune,&rdquo; Daego burst forth in a
sudden rage, &ldquo;and what do I get? A laugh. What
sort of people are these ones from the United States?
They call you dollar men. I offer you dollars, many,
many dollars&mdash;your own American dollars&mdash;and all
you offer me for answer is a smile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not smile again. The situation was
grave enough. He had been foolhardy to cross the
river without his men. Daego was flanked by six
husky Spaniards and at the side of each was a gleaming
machete. Johnny was backed only by a wall of
cohune-nut tree stems. He hoped and prayed that
they might prove fairly well rotted when his moment
came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The camp in which Johnny had enjoyed his wild
turkey dinner was a chicle camp. Up until these last
few minutes Daego had proven a most perfect host.
The food he offered was the best the jungle could
provide. He was politeness itself, with one and the
same breath pressing food and compliments upon his
guest.</p>
<p>One peculiarity of the man&rsquo;s nature disgusted
Johnny. He seemed at every turn to wish to impress
Johnny with respect and awe for his wealth and
power. Before dinner he had showed Johnny about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he had explained, &ldquo;is one of my many chicle
camps. I import into Honduras every year more than
two million pounds of chicle. The price, as you know,
is fifty cents a pound. The profit,&rdquo; he smiled out of
one corner of his mouth, &ldquo;the profit is, well, very
large&mdash;perhaps half. These men work very cheaply;
like slaves they are, almost; always in debt to me.
I employ them by the thousands. You have no idea
how many. For that matter, neither have I. This
Rio Hondo, this Black River, has made me rich, rich
and powerful. On the Rio Hondo I am, you might
say, a king.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>And now this &ldquo;king&rdquo; of the Black River, with a
strong backing of his armed men, was attempting to
bribe or brow-beat&mdash;he apparently did not care which&mdash;a
red-blooded, honest American boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this Black River,&rdquo; he repeated now, as they
sat at the table, &ldquo;on this river I am king. It is I who
have always developed its industries and I it shall be
in the future, and none other! I have offered you
money&mdash;money not that you should speak an untruth,
but that you should return to the people who control
your tract and say to them: &lsquo;There is no profit to
be made in a quest for your red lure and your
chicle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it not so?&rdquo; He showed all his white
teeth in a half smile, half snarl. &ldquo;I&mdash;will I not see
that you make no profit, that no other person beside
myself make a profit? More than twenty thousand
dollars I offer you&mdash;for what? That you may tell
the truth to a friend. What could be easier than
that? Now I ask you for the last time&mdash;do you take
that money or must I resort to harsher methods?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think well!&rdquo; He held up a finger of warning,
&ldquo;I am a millionaire. Thousands serve me. They
are all in debt to me. They are my slaves. The Rio
Hondo is mine. All I need do is to stretch out a
hand and take.&rdquo; He swung his arm in a dramatic
gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I,&rdquo; he went on, purring now like a cat, &ldquo;I
am not a man who loves violence. See! Here is
proof. Here is money, twenty thousand American
dollars. And for what? For peace. What do you
say now? Do you take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Americans,&rdquo; said Johnny with a ghost of a
smile about the corners of his mouth, &ldquo;do not talk.
We act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he seized the small table before him,
swung it above his head and sent it crashing through
the frail side of the hut, then followed it through
the hole it had made in the rotten walls of the cohune-nut
stems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />NARROW ESCAPES</h2>
<p>To say that Pant was surprised at sight of the
jaguar, the well-known &ldquo;killer&rdquo; above him in the
bread-nut tree, would poorly express it. For once in
his young life he was without a solution to the problem
that lay just before him. He knew that he must
act, and act instantly. But what to do? Thirty feet
below him was the solid earth, far too solid. Through
the gathering shadows he thought he saw directly beneath
him the wide spreading leaves of a young
cohune-nut tree. Of this he could not be sure. In any
event these soft yielding leaves would offer slight
cushion at the end of a thirty foot fall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Flight back over the limb, the way he had come,
was not to be thought of. The instant he began
creeping forward the great cat would be upon his
back. To remain in his present position was equally
perilous. There was his machete, to be sure, but
what was this against the claws of a man-eater? It
would doubtless be knocked from his hand at the first
spring of the spotted beast.</p>
<p>The great cat&rsquo;s tail ceased to lash the twigs. The
boy&rsquo;s heart beat wildly. Was the end at hand?</p>
<p>Time passed. Ten seconds seemed an hour, and
yet no spring. And then, of a sudden, there flashed
into his mind a desperate chance, yet it was a chance&mdash;at
least something to do.</p>
<p>He was now sitting with his back to the tiger, looking
over his shoulder. Slowly, with his eyes fixed
steadily on the killer, he began to turn about on the
limb. It was a hazardous undertaking. Should he
slip, lose his balance, fall, it might mean death. But
this was a moment for hazards.</p>
<p>Swinging a leg over the limb, he sat sidewise for
an instant; then with a second swing the thing was
accomplished. Still the killer lingered. The tail was
lashing furiously now, sending dry twigs flying downward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Pant began sliding back upon the limb. With eyes
still fixed upon the tiger, with heart beating like a
throbbing motor, he moved back a foot, two feet,
three, four. Still the tiger waited. His eyes, in the
gathering darkness, had turned to red balls of fire.</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy&rsquo;s hand went up. The machete
was raised above his head. The great cat gave forth
a blood-curdling snarl. But the big knife was not
meant for him.</p>
<p>Once in his boyhood days on a farm Pant had
climbed far out over the track that ran beneath the
ridge of a tall hay-loft. He had gone out to adjust
something that had gone wrong with the double harpoon
fork. It would not trip. He had used every
ounce of his strength climbing out there hand over
hand. He had not dared attempt the trip back. The
hay of the loft was twenty feet beneath him. There
was a load on the fork. Choosing the least of three
evils, he had taken the drop with the half-ton of hay
when the fork was tripped. He would not soon forget
that breath-taking drop, yet he had landed without
a bump or bruise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he told himself as calmly as he could,
&ldquo;will be exactly like that&mdash;maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>He was now seated firmly on the great clump of
&ldquo;tree grass.&rdquo; Some three feet across, this clump
hung down a distance of two yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the last &ldquo;now&rdquo; out loud and at the same
instant the machete came down upon the branch on
which he sat.</p>
<p>It was a master stroke. Bent as it was by its double
load, the branch snapped clean off and instantly
the boy shot downward through space.</p>
<p>One breath-taking instant, then bump! He landed
with a thud that made his teeth rattle, then pitched
head foremost into the brush.</p>
<p>Hardly had he had time to realize that he was
still conscious and probably unharmed, when there
came, not four feet from him, a terrible thud.</p>
<p>Once more his mind was in a whirl. What had
happened? Had the tiger, angered at loss of his prey,
risked a thirty-foot leap to the ground? It seemed
incredible, yet there he was.</p>
<p>For the answer to his problem regarding the
jaguar who had dropped in the bush beside him,
Pant did not have long to wait. For ten seconds, as
if stunned, the great cat remained where he was,
then with a sudden rush he dashed wildly away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The boy laughed a low laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity it didn&rsquo;t kill him,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>He had guessed what had happened. Suddenly
released, the limb on which he had been seated had
shot upward and, striking the jaguar, had perhaps
stunned him. At least it had unseated him and he
had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Pant grinned, &ldquo;here is plenty of hay
to last poor old Rip for three days. I came down
rather sooner than I expected and in a manner quite
unusual. Wouldn&rsquo;t care to try it again, but it did
work that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Searching out his machete, he hacked the grass
from the limb, tied it in three bundles, then began
making his way back to his boat with one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get after that beast,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;If
the Caribs hear too much of him they may take fright
and desert us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not long in putting this resolve into execution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Daego thought he had been quite shrewd in his
choice of the spot to be occupied by his guest. There
were no windows to the hut. Light entered between
the palm walls. The rich half-caste and his six men
sat before the door and that way lay the path to the
river. Back of the place where Johnny had been
seated was the jungle, an all but impenetrable mass
of palms, great mahogany trees and creeping, twining
vines.</p>
<p>As Johnny sent the table crashing through the
flimsy, rotting walls of the hut he followed after it
so closely that both he and the table made their exit
at almost the same instant. He had but one thought&mdash;to
get into the jungle as quickly as possible. It was
his only chance. Daego and his natives, surprised
into temporary inaction by this sudden turn of affairs,
were delayed just long enough to permit Johnny to
get into the jungle. After that, Johnny knew, it
would be a game of &ldquo;hide and seek&rdquo; with at least a
fair chance for escape.</p>
<p>A moment after Johnny had dived headlong into
the dark, dank jungle, Daego&rsquo;s men came tumbling
through the newly made hole in the wall of the hut,
eager to win their master&rsquo;s praise by seizing this unarmed
boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>But so tardy and clumsy was their pursuit that
Johnny had gained enough distance to cover up the
sound of his movements. For the moment, at least,
the advantage was his. But what if he did make
good his escape? Where would he go? How could
he hope to make his way back to his own camp?</p>
<p>Without thinking much of the outcome, more from
instinct than reason, like a rabbit close pressed by
the hounds, he leaped for the jungle.</p>
<p>By some good or evil chance he came at once upon
one of those low, narrow trails made by the small
short horned deer that abound in that wilderness.
By stooping quite low, almost bent double, he was
able to make rapid progress.</p>
<p>After covering a hundred yards he paused to listen.</p>
<p>Yes, he could hear the men shouting and beating
the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a hundred of them,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;And dogs! Trapped here by dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and fairly flew down the trail.</p>
<p>On and on and on, not knowing where, but ever
on until at last with hands and face bleeding and
clothes in rags, he fell flat in the trail and lay there
motionless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />LOST IN THE JUNGLE</h2>
<p>Could Johnny have witnessed the dismay and confusion
caused by his sudden escape he would have
felt far less concerned over his present plight. The
first eager pursuers crashed wildly about in the jungle,
rushing forward at every sound only to discover that
it was made by another hunter instead of the hunted.
Their shouts brought other men pouring from the
huts and a half score of dogs, who jumped about
and added to the din with their senseless yelping.</p>
<p>Daego shouted directions, but his shouts were
either unheard or not clearly understood. Then he
made an attempt to set the dogs on Johnny&rsquo;s trail.
There were dogs a-plenty to overtake Johnny and
slay him but for one thing&mdash;dogs are never eager to
enter a tropical jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>Unaccompanied by his master, the native dog seldom
goes far into that tangled mass of vegetation.
There are reasons enough for this. Poisonous
snakes, ten feet long, lurk in the decay at the base
of great trees. Jaguars, prepared to pounce upon a
dog, lie flat along great branches, and the uncouth
&ldquo;mountain cow&rdquo; (tapir) is all too ready to tear
him to pieces with her sharp hoofs.</p>
<p>So, though urged on by their enraged masters, the
dogs did not venture far and soon enough came crawling
back, their defeat registered by drooping tails.</p>
<p>So Johnny Thompson was safe. And yet, was he
safe? As the dull agony of exhaustion left him, he
began, in a slow, numb sort of way, to remember where
he was. He was in a tropical jungle. It was early
dusk and the coming night would be made hideous
by the barking of alligators, the scream of wild parrots
and the hoarse call of jaguars. To move down
the trail after darkness would be dangerous. Curled
on that trail might be a great snake whose fangs offered
sure death. Further movement might call a
jaguar to leap upon him from the tree tops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>On the other hand, if he went forward on this trail
he might come to water. Already his throat was
parched, his tongue swollen. Then, too, a small stream
meant a certain amount of protection and a possible
fire. He had matches in his pocket, a small box of
them. As he thought of these he wrapped them in
his handkerchief for safer keeping.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden a more terrible realization came
to him. Not only was he in a tropical jungle, but he
was lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; he whispered in an awed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; &ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; the strange rustle of palms
seemed to answer back.</p>
<p>It was true, must be true. Hardgrave, who had
spent years in the jungle, had warned him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
ever dare to enter that jungle without a guide, not to
go even a few rods. If you do, you&rsquo;re lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rods,&rdquo; Johnny repeated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gone miles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he thought of it now, he realized that he must
have crossed scores of these low, criss-crossings paths.
Should he will to attempt it, he could not in a thousand
days find his way back to Daego&rsquo;s clearing over
that dry sponge-like patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor any other place,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
lost! Lost!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>At first the thought left him so weak that he could
not move. But in time strength and courage came
flooding back. He was young, strong, resourceful.
There was a way out. He would find it. Daego was
doubtless at this moment sitting in his cabin smoking
cigarets and contemplating the day when he would
move across the river and take charge of Johnny&rsquo;s
deserted camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will never be!&rdquo; Johnny told himself, setting
his teeth hard.</p>
<p>To his surprise, as his hand went to his knee he
found his clothing wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have crossed some small stream and in my
wild fear, never knew it. No more of that. I&rsquo;ll be
calm. I must be calm&mdash;and I must think clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stream,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;means water for drinking
and a place of greater safety. What&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he
exclaimed, attempting to spring to his feet only to be
tossed back by closely woven vines and branches,
&ldquo;that means a way out. A small stream flows into
a large one; the larger one into one still larger, and
in time one comes to Rio Hondo, the old Black River.
There I might find a rotting native cabin and perhaps
a dugout for floating down to my camp. But first
I must find the beginning. There is a beginning to
all things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>He contemplated the gathering darkness. There
was yet a little time. Which way should he go? He
shuddered at the thought of going back. There
seemed to be an equally good chance ahead. So,
slowly, always with an eye out for those terrible
snakes, he crept forward into the gathering gloom.</p>
<p>As time went on he struggled forward, and as the
darkness deepened it seemed to him that he must,
Tarzan-like, spend the night in some great mahogany
or Santa Maria tree. The thought was depressing.
His throat ached from thirst. There were jaguars
in the trees. Exhausted as he was, he might fall
asleep and plunge from the tree to his death.</p>
<p>As this thought came near to a conviction and when
hope had all but fled, he rounded a sudden turn in the
trail and his eyes were half blinded by a light which
was much brighter than the gloom to which his eyes
had been accustomed. The light was at the spot where
the bush and the trail appeared to end,&mdash;a distance of
less than a hundred yards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>What could it mean? Had fate played a trick on
him? Had he followed a circle in the jungle, only
to return to Daego&rsquo;s camp? Was this some other
clearing? If so, whose could it be?</p>
<p>For a moment he remained there motionless, staring.
Then, with a speed born of sudden hope and
maddening fear, he sprinted forward toward the light.</p>
<p>Even as he moved forward the light faded, and
night, such night as only the jungle knows, settled
down over all.</p>
<p>Driven half mad by this sudden fading of his
dreams, throwing all caution aside, Johnny rushed
straight on until, with a sudden gasp, he threw himself
backward. One foot had plunged into water.
In another second he would have pitched head-foremost
into some stream; what stream he could not
know. The thing he did know very soon was that out
in the water some little distance away gleamed two
red balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes of an alligator,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Well,
anyway, here is water.&rdquo; He drank greedily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>As he attempted to pierce the darkness about him,
he was able to guess what it was that had caused the
unusual light. The sky, dimly visible through overhanging
branches, was filled with black clouds. There
had come, without doubt, one of those last sudden
flashes of sunsets which gleam out, then are lost forever.
This light shining upon the water had been
dazzling in its intensity. Because of its very intensity
the following darkness had appeared quite complete.</p>
<p>Once his eyes had become accustomed to the feeble
light, Johnny was able to distinguish some of the
black bulks about him. Downstream, hanging far
over the water, was a palm. Upstream he caught
the dim outline of some dull gray masses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rocks, I hope,&rdquo; he murmured as he moved slowly
in that direction.</p>
<p>There was now reason enough for caution. Sharp-nosed
alligators of these streams sometimes slept on
the banks. To disturb one was to invite disaster.
To break a twig or make any other unusual sound
might be to call other wild creatures to attack him.</p>
<p>So, parting the branches with great care, he moved
on cautiously until with a grateful heart he put a
hand out to touch a huge rough boulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Mounted upon this heap of rough rocks, of which
there were five, each as large as a sleeping elephant,
he breathed more freely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a little fire,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;All wild
things fear fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long until the stream, which appeared
to be some twenty feet wide at this point, was lighted
by the blazing flames of quick burning palm leaves.</p>
<p>Sudden as was the blaze, even more sudden was
its fading. Looking away from the red glow of
coals, Johnny tried to peer into the dense darkness
that followed. He could distinguish only the red
gleam of eyes. They were all about him; upon the
water, on the bank, in the tree tops.</p>
<p>Monkeys, fierce black little creatures, chattered from
the tallest trees. From the ground sounded many
odd grunts, which the boy could not interpret. Coming
down the river, like a dimly lighted floating
burial procession, were the silent alligators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very strange and&mdash;and somewhat spooky,&rdquo;
he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>With a shudder he seized a dully glowing brand
and, having fanned it into flame, went boldly forth
in search of wood. This time he would gather more
substantial material. His fire must last longer, much
longer, for somehow he must snatch a little sleep.</p>
<p>Waving his firebrand before him in one hand, he
gathered fuel with the other. Some dead ferns and
palm branches, the fallen branch of a black tamarind,
the half rotted stem of a yamra, some large branches
of a tree quite unknown to him, all these would send
the light of his fire gleaming out into the night for
hours to come.</p>
<p>Soon, with his fire glowing cheerily, he settled down
on a chair-like rock crevice and with head bent forward,
hands hanging down before him, every muscle
relaxed, he tried to induce sleep to come.</p>
<p>It did not come at once. His mind worked on.
Across its silver screen there passed a long procession
of pictures. The trip up the river, the wild forest, the
dark Caribs all about him, the silent black river, Daego
seated before the table, money, twenty thousand dollars
fluttering before him, the surprised look of the
Spaniards as the table tore through the wall, then the
jungle, the terrible uncertain jungle with its wild perils
and its noisesome nights.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Then, as will happen when half thoughts and half
dreams come, the reel changed. He was sitting with
old Hardgrave, his friend who had seen sixty-eight
summers, twenty-five of them in the tropics. In the
cool shade of the hotel porch at Belize the old man
was showing him a crudely drawn map and was pointing
to a spot on that map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever get to that spot,&rdquo; he seemed to hear
him say, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find Indian gods. I have seen them.
Three of them, a black one, a blue one, and one of
pure gold. I don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ll come back to tell anyone
about it,&rdquo; the old man smiled a queer smile. &ldquo;They
say it&rsquo;s dangerous to go up there and I reckon it is.
Truth is, no one knows the way there and back. It&rsquo;s
up in the bush somewhere. That&rsquo;s all anyone knows.
It&rsquo;s all I know, and I&rsquo;ve been there once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I didn&rsquo;t mean to go there,&rdquo; he
reminisced. &ldquo;They found me sick with a fever, the
Indians did, and carried me to their village in the
bush and cured me up. Wanted me to stay on with
them. Seemed to sort of take a liking to me. I told
them I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;At first they said I didn&rsquo;t have any choice in the
matter. Took me to see some bones, human bones.
White man&rsquo;s bones I&rsquo;d say from the size of them.
Then they took me back to the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something changed their minds, though. I don&rsquo;t
know what. One day they blindfolded me and took
me through the bush and downstream for a whole
day. When my eyes were uncovered I found myself
in a dugout on a part of the Rio Hondo that I knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Johnny,&rdquo; he added with a rare smile, &ldquo;if
you really want some Maya gods, you just hunt that
place up. They&rsquo;ve got some black ones, and some
that are green, and at least one of pure gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did want one or two of these Maya Indian
gods. A very good friend had asked him to bring
back one or two for his collection. He had promised
to perform this commission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no notion they were so hard to get,&rdquo; he told
himself now. &ldquo;It would be strange if I should
stumble upon those Mayas up here somewhere,&mdash;strange
and rather startling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black gods and green ones, and at least one of
pure gold,&rdquo; he repeated, half asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Then of a sudden he started up. His fire was
burning low. After throwing on a fresh supply of
fuel, he thought more clearly of the consequences if
he should fall into the hands of these strange bush
people. He was not at all sure that, once they had
found him, they would allow him to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;our camp would fall
into the hands of Daego unless&mdash;unless Pant were
strong enough and resourceful enough to hold his own
against that wily half-caste rascal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Pant,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;what will he think
when I don&rsquo;t return? I hope he doesn&rsquo;t start a big
fight right off the bat. He must not. I must return.
Somehow I must get back. I&rsquo;ll do it, too! See if I
don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll make some sort of raft and float down
this stream from nowhere to somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he fell asleep and, as the fire burned low,
the glow of eyes from the river, in the trees, on
the ground, moved closer and ever closer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />PERIL IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>As for Pant, he was worried enough by Johnny&rsquo;s
prolonged absence. It had been dark for fully three
hours. Having returned from his gathering of tree
hay and his brush with the jaguar, he had gone down
to the creek landing to wait for Johnny.</p>
<p>Two anxious hours passed and still he did not
come. For a half hour he paced the creek trail in
deep and troubled thought. Over and over, as a squirrel
turns his cage, questions revolved in his mind.
What was keeping Johnny? Should he go for him?
Had he been attacked, perhaps slain? Who could
tell, if he went to Daego&rsquo;s camp, what would happen?
Johnny had left him in charge of the camp. If something
should happen to him, should he fail to return,
the Caribs would pile into their boats and go drifting
down the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Johnny left me here to
carry on in his absence, and carry on it is. If he
does not appear by morning I&rsquo;ll send a messenger to
Daego&rsquo;s camp to find out what he has to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did send a messenger in the morning. The
millionaire half-caste received him with the greatest
courtesy. Johnny, he said, had indeed had dinner
with him and they had enjoyed quite a long chat
when the meal was over. The boy had left his camp
in quite a hurry on account of the gathering darkness.
He had not seen him since that time.</p>
<p>Daego assumed an attitude of greatest surprise
upon being told that Johnny had not returned to his
own camp and expressed the hope that he might soon
learn of his safety. The Rio Hondo was a treacherous
river, treacherous indeed.</p>
<p>All of which was more or less true, and at the same
time a most diabolical lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a crook and a scoundrel!&rdquo; Pant raged to
himself when the messenger had made his report.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done something to Johnny, locked him up, or
sent him up some river, a prisoner. Depend on that.
But he&rsquo;ll not get his way on our side of the river!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>After laying out the day&rsquo;s work for his men, Pant
sat down on a red log and indulged in some long,
long thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way to keep a man from making trouble for
you,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is to make as much trouble
for him as you can. A fight like this is just like a
game of chess. If you can keep a man busy getting
his knights, bishops and castles out of danger he
isn&rsquo;t like to make much trouble for your king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time he sat blinking at the little patches
of sunshine that filtered down though the tropical
foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a capital ghost story Hardgrave told
me when I was down at Belize,&rdquo; he told himself at last
with a little chuckle. &ldquo;Happened on one of the
islands, but I&rsquo;ll bet it would work right up here. He
promised to send me up the things I need for trying
it if any sort of craft comes up this way. Don&rsquo;t suppose
there&rsquo;s much chance, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that I hear?&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting up
suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Hurrying down the river trail, he was just in
time to see four pit-pans moving slowly up the river.
The pit-pans, great dugouts sixty feet long, were
loaded with Spaniards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daego&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Re-inforcements.
He doesn&rsquo;t need them for work. I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cold dread gripped his heart. Daego was assembling
his men. This addition would give him a force
double the number of their Caribs. Could it be that,
in the absence of their leader, he meant to lead an
attack at once? There would be a fight, a battle
to the finish between Johnny&rsquo;s forces and Daego&rsquo;s.
Caribs against Spaniards, but Pant hadn&rsquo;t expected
it for some time yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I had the stuff Hardgrave promised to
send,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Might thin that force out a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stuff Hardgrave had promised was on its way
and much nearer to Johnny&rsquo;s wild lumber camp than
Pant guessed. Hardgrave was on his way, too; in
fact, he was bringing the supplies up the river at that
moment. It was a strange assortment of articles that
he carried in a box beneath the seat in his little motor
boat; a dozen or so of large blue toy balloons, a bottle
of phosphorus, a number of yards of cheesecloth,
some putty, three tubes of glue, two metal retorts and
two packages of chemicals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; up the Hondo,&rdquo; he had said to a friend before
he set out. &ldquo;Coupla boys up there a tryin&rsquo; to
do a little stunt of bringing out some of the red lure.
Jest boys, they are; no match for that crafty Daego.
Reckon I&rsquo;ll jest run up there and give &rsquo;em a little
help for, after all, they&rsquo;re from the United States
and so am I, though I been down here quite a spell,
and all us folks from up there has to sort of hang
together. It&mdash;it&rsquo;s sort of in the blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Pant was soon to receive re-inforcements. The
re-inforcements consisted of but one man, but there
are times when one is as good as a host.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Morning brought bitter disappointment to Johnny.
He had hoped that the palm tree he had seen down
the creek was a cocoanut tree. The milk even of a
green cocoanut is sweet and refreshing. Since ripe
nuts fall the year round, there was reason to hope
too that some of these might be found on the ground.
But early morning light revealed a cohune nut
tree. True, there were great clusters of nuts hanging
from this tree, but these Johnny had been told
were composed mostly of a hard shell. The meat,
such as there was of it, was dry and indigestible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;got to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he worked his way downstream to the tree.
After spending a half hour cracking three nuts, and
finding their meat meager and tough, he turned to
other quarters for food.</p>
<p>A tropical wilderness abounds in fruit. The
strangest, most unheard of trees in the world were
at Johnny&rsquo;s very elbow. The fruit of many of these
was good to eat. Some might be eaten raw; others
were delicious when cooked. But some, too, were
deadly poison. Which might be eaten? Which not?
This he could not tell. To his right was a tree
laden with a green cucumber-like fruit, and over to
his left one that hung heavy with long yellow muskmellons,
or so they seemed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only knew!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;If I only did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He recalled hours wasted that might have been
put to good use roaming the jungle with one of his
Caribs, learning the use and value of these plants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I get back in safety I&rsquo;ll never waste another
hour!&rdquo; he resolved.&mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn, and learn and learn
until there is not an important thing in this wilderness
that I do not have some accurate knowledge of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, his stomach was crying
loudly for food. Food? Without doubt there was
plenty at hand, but he dared not eat it.</p>
<p>There were fishes in the stream. He could see
them calmly fanning the water in a pool beside the
rocks. Fish were always good. His mouth watered
at thought of the fry he would have on the hot rocks.
But he had no hooks. He tried a snare of tie-tie
vine, but the fish were too quick for him.</p>
<p>At last, despairing of his undertaking, he dropped
on hands and knees to creep away into the bush. He
had not gone far before his heart was gladdened by
what he saw just before him. It was a hot, humid
morning. A peccary, a little wild pig, with her half
grown brood, having without doubt spent the cooler
hours of night hunting grubs and roots, lay stretched
out on a bed of dead ferns, fast asleep. One of the
young porkers, lying with his two hind feet close
together, was not twelve feet from where Johnny
lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A quick grab at those feet, a sudden get-away,
and I have my breakfast,&rdquo; he thought as he moved
cautiously forward. &ldquo;That fellow doesn&rsquo;t weigh
over ten pounds dressed, but that&rsquo;s enough food for
two days and by that time I&rsquo;ll be back to camp.&rdquo;
Oh, vain hope!</p>
<p>Right hand out, right foot forward; left hand,
left foot. So he moved ahead. Now half the distance
was covered and still the little wild pigs slept.
Now he was within arm&rsquo;s length of his prey. Then,
rising to his knees, he shot out a hand. There came
a wild, piercing squeal, then all was commotion.</p>
<p>Quicker than he could think, the old peccary was
after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insignificant little brute,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I could
brain you with a single blow of a club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no club, had not thought of that.</p>
<p>A convenient tree offered protection. Clinging to
his squealing prey, he leaped to the first branch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away in a moment,&rdquo; he told himself as with
his clasp-knife he silenced the squeals of the young
porker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>To his immense surprise, as he looked down he
saw that the ground was literally alive with angry,
grunting peccary pigs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d they all come from?&rdquo; he asked an hour
later, as for the twentieth time he adjusted his sore
muscles to their cramped position.</p>
<p>This question no one could answer. The angry
horde had apparently declared the tree to be in a
state of siege. And, though they were small, they
were terrible to look at. There were gnarled old
fathers of that herd whose ugly yellow tusks, curled
twice round, stood out at the end like spears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rip a fellow to pieces before he&rsquo;d gone ten
steps,&rdquo; groaned the boy.</p>
<p>As his position in this small mahogany tree with
its smooth limbs became all but unbearable, he cast
about for relief. Next to this tree was a larger one
and beyond that a great, broad-spreading palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I can reach the palm,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;I will at least have a comfortable place to rest
and maybe grab a few moments of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Tying the dead peccary to his back, he climbed
out as far as he dared upon his limb, then executed
a sort of flying leap for the next tree. It was a daring
venture, but a successful one. Five minutes later,
with the carefully dressed peccary meat hanging
nearby, he sank into a cushioned depth of the palm
tree and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>Some time later, much later, he awoke. At first,
as he attempted to gaze about him, he could not believe
his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;There has been
an eclipse. I have gone blind. It can&rsquo;t be night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was. Overcome by exhaustion and the
humid heat of the tropics, he had slept the day through
and a short way into the night. So had passed the
day that was to have seen his raft built and launched,
to have seen him on his way back to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am!&rdquo; he exclaimed in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I now have some
supper and may make my way back to the rock and
cook it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can I?&rdquo; he started. &ldquo;What of that wild
horde with their ugly yellow tusks? Are they still
waiting down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he hesitated. Then, with a sudden
resolve born of necessity, he began to descend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />DEATH AHEAD</h2>
<p>Peccary meat was Johnny&rsquo;s supper. A dry supper
it was, and old Father Gloom sat across the fire
from him while he ate. To have wasted a whole day;
to face a second night of vigil; to recall those pairs
of burning, greedy, red eyes; to know that with the
passing of the hours the owners of those eyes must certainly
grow bolder; all this was depressing in the extreme.
To add to this set of depressing circumstances,
a small thing happened; a very small thing indeed,
but fraught with great consequences. There were not
many mosquitos in this place at this time. The streams
were swift, and at this time of year there were no
water holes for breeding them.</p>
<p>For all this, a single mosquito, drifting in from
nowhere, alighted on Johnny&rsquo;s hand and began to drill.
He had half finished his task when, without thinking,
Johnny crushed him at a blow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Instantly the boy&rsquo;s mind was filled with foreboding.
He had been bitten by a mosquito! One thing Hardgrave
had said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, wherever you are, don&rsquo;t ever lie down
to sleep, not even in the daytime, without a mosquito-bar
net over you. Malaria. The mosquitos carry it.
It&rsquo;s the only way you can get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In camp they always slept beneath canopies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But out here,&rdquo; Johnny grinned a wry grin,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the chance? Well, if that was a malaria
mosquito he&rsquo;s got me loaded up good and plenty,
and there&rsquo;s no use bothering my mind about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not bother his mind, but it bothered him.
In his imagination he saw himself delirious with fever,
insensible to his surroundings, wandering down narrow
trails, tripped by vines, torn at by brambles.
Watched from every dark hole and tree top by wild
beasts, he saw himself struggle on until burned out
by fever, exhausted by aimless, senseless endeavor,
he at last lay down to die.</p>
<p>Shaking himself free from the haunting spectre,
he threw fresh wood upon the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>He slept little that night, and welcomed the dawn
less eagerly than he had the day before. He felt a
desire to be idle, a dreamy indifference creeping over
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the tropics,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Everyone
slows up down here. The heat and the humidity
makes you want to drag your feet, to loaf, to sit and
dream. But I must not! I must act! Act! Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he went at the task of building a raft and
before noon it was completed.</p>
<p>A crude affair it was, to be sure. Dry logs of
different lengths; there was no axe for hewing them.
All these, bound clumsily together with tough tie-tie
vine, made up the raft that eventually carried Johnny
away from the great rocks and swiftly down the
river. As far as he could see ahead, branches formed
a perfect arch over the water, and at places hung so
low that it was necessary for him to lie flat down to
avoid being dragged off into the water.</p>
<p>He bade farewell to his rocky home with no regrets,
but with some misgivings after all. He was
to drift off into the unknown. What awaited him
there? Who could tell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s like death,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>With this mood there drifted into his mind a bit
of verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I know not where His islands lift</p>
<p class="t0">Their fronded palms in air,</p>
<p class="t0">I only know I cannot drift</p>
<p class="t0">Beyond His love and care.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>He felt a strange tightening at the throat as the
words escaped his lips, and he blessed the teacher
who had given them to him for just such a time as
this.</p>
<p>Many and strange were the sensations that came
to him as he drifted silently, swiftly beneath this
cathedral-like arch of trees. A green parrot screamed
at him as it fluttered away; a black monkey with a
white face, clinging to a limb by a foot and his tail,
scolded at him as he passed. A slow-moving snake,
hanging from a tree trunk, darted out a black tongue.
The jagged corner of the clumsy raft, catching on a
snag, hung there while the water, warm as soapsuds,
washed over the raft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Loosened, the raft whirled on. More swiftly now
they moved. The current was gaining strength. Rocks
appeared, one to the right, one to the left, and one
amid stream. The arch of trees rose higher. A patch
of blue appeared. Rising to his feet, Johnny struggled
with all his might, darting his pole first one side
and then the other, to keep the raft off the rocks.
Then suddenly, without warning, he was seized by
an overhanging vine and dragged clear of the raft.</p>
<p>That was a tragic moment. With his raft went
his last bit of food; and with it, too, for a moment
his last bit of hope. With an eye out for drifting
alligators, he swam strongly after the runaway raft.</p>
<p>Fortune favored him. For a moment the raft,
caught in a corner between two rocks, hung motionless
and in that moment, breathless, exhausted, he
climbed aboard. At the same instant he sensed the
presence of a wakened alligator nearby.</p>
<p>Quite motionless he lay for a full moment as the
raft rushed on. This was no time for inaction. Faster,
ever faster glided the raft; faster, faster the trees
flew by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>And now a new catastrophe threatened. A sharp
rock had cut one of the tie-tie vines that bound the
raft. In another moment the raft might be torn in
bits, leaving Johnny in the water, beyond hope. Seizing
a fresh vine, he passed it over the ends of the
logs and by exerting all his strength drew them to
place and bound them there.</p>
<p>And now came a respite. Suddenly the river
broadened. Blue sky appeared above him. He was
floating slowly on the surface of a small lake.</p>
<p>Drawing his feet up under him, he gave himself
over to much needed rest and enjoyment of the scene
that lay before him. Surely here was beauty untouched
by the hand of man. Had man&rsquo;s eyes ever
looked upon it? Surely no eyes of civilized man. Yet
what a gleaming of blue waters, what a blending of
matchless green and faultless blue!</p>
<p>If he did not allow his mind to linger long on all
this matchless beauty of spreading palms, clinging
vines and reflecting water, it was because the more
practical side of his nature sought two things&mdash;a native
hut and a cocoanut palm tree. One of these
would be a boon indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>And one appeared. A leaning cocoanut tree hung
over the water at the very spot where the lake ended
and the current grew swift again. He saw it at the
moment when his raft, caught by a stronger current,
shot forward. At that same moment came a disturbing
sound, a deep, low thunder that he did not wholly
understand.</p>
<p>In his confusion of thought he all but lost his opportunity.
Leaping to his feet, he struck at the palm
with his long pole. Once, twice, three times he clubbed
it, and with the third blow a ripe cocoanut came
hurtling down to splash in the water beside his raft.</p>
<p>With a little cry of joy he dropped his pole and
all but sprang in the water after it. Restraining this
impulse, he dropped on hands and knees to reach for
it. It was just beyond his grasp. The pole&mdash;yes, with
the pole he could drag it to him. Sending the pole
sweeping out over the water, he was about to bring
the fugitive dinner to him when the raft, striking a
submerged rock, whirled about and left him three
full yards from the prize. At the same time there
came to his ears again that dull thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be a storm,&rdquo; he said, scanning the sky.
&ldquo;Clear as a bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly he watched the cocoanut as, abreast of his
strange craft, but just out of reach of his pole, it
drifted onward. Within that brown husk was delicious,
refreshing drink and nourishing food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Fate seemed to mock him. The current having carried
the cocoanut within his reach, quickly whirled
it away again. Then, tempting him, it whirled it
close only to catch it and fling it at last into a backwater
eddy where it was lost to him forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thundering sound is growing more distinct,&rdquo;
he told himself as, resigned to his loss, he
settled down for a moment&rsquo;s rest. &ldquo;I wonder what
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden he knew and the realization
stunned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Falls!&rdquo; he said, leaping excitedly to his feet.
&ldquo;Falls in this river. Falls straight ahead!&rdquo; The next
moment he lay stunned, half unconscious on the raft.
He had been struck on the head by an overhanging
limb.</p>
<p>How long he lay there he will never know. Enough
to say that when at last he struggled back to a sitting
position the thunder of the falls filled all the air, while
the trees and bushes, as if borne on by a cyclone, sped
by him at unbelievable speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gotta stop!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Gotta get offa here
somehow! Death in the falls. Won&rsquo;t do! Gotta
get off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>With a mighty effort he dragged his scattered
senses together. The next instant he found himself
gripping the tough branches of a red mangrove tree,
while his raft shot on to its doom.</p>
<p>With a sinking sensation about his heart and a
dull pain in his head, Johnny saw his hope of an early
return to camp disappear downstream. On that raft
was tied a bit of peccary meat, the only morsel of
food he had in the world. Yet where there is life
there is hope, and after climbing carefully back over
the limb that had saved him, he descended the tree
to the ground.</p>
<p>An hour of struggling forward, sometimes through
thickets, sometimes over rocks or through water to
his waist, he ended at the top of a steep precipice
that stood thirty feet above the side of a most beautiful
waterfall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful things at times become terrible,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;My raft is gone; my dinner with it.
These beautiful falls took them. No use to waste
time in vain regrets. I&rsquo;ve got to get down some
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>After exploring every corner he became convinced
that there was no suggestion of a rugged stairway
anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to be some other way,&rdquo; he thought wearily.
Having glanced at a towering sapodilla tree, he noticed
that a wild fig vine grew up its side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a rope of it. Let myself down,&rdquo; he said,
beginning to unlace his shoes.</p>
<p>Having climbed the tree for a distance of forty feet,
he cut the vine and began stripping off a stem an inch
in diameter. It was a long and dangerous task, for
these vines, with a grip of death, in time hug the very
life out of a tree. But in time he won and, attaching
one end of the vine rope to the trunk of a tree, dropped
it over the precipice. He then began nimbly following
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a cocoanut palm there by the pool at
the foot of the falls. If it is, I know where I get my
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a cocoanut palm, a low one, standing
not more than ten feet from the ground, but bearing
cocoanuts all the same. He had not descended half
way before he could count them. There were many
green ones and three that were brown and ripe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Um-yum-yum!&rdquo; he smacked his lips as he seemed
to feel the rich white milk go gurgling down his
throat.</p>
<p>He was still looking at that tree and trying to
figure out how he could best reach it, when he suddenly
discovered that he was all but at the bottom.</p>
<p>He had given no thought to what that landing
might be like. He glanced downward, then with
hands that trembled so he could scarcely open and
close them he made desperate efforts to climb back.</p>
<p>Had he dropped another foot he must surely have
fallen into the jaws of a mammoth alligator. The
beast was asleep with his mouth wide open. Grinning
terribly, his yellow tusks looking like rows of
sharpened spikes, he lay there quite motionless. What
would have been the consequences had the boy
dropped that remaining foot? Would the alligator
have tumbled in great fright into the water? Would
his terrible jaws have closed like the iron gates of a
prison? Who can tell? Who would care to perform
the experiment that he might know?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime Pant had not been idle. Good
old Hardgrave, a plain man from Arkansas with the
courage of a knight and heart of a king, had arrived.
He had anchored his motor-boat with its wheezy engine
close to the creek landing, then had unloaded his
cargo of chemicals, retorts, toy balloons and cheesecloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Johnny?&rdquo; he asked the moment he
stepped on land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was going to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant did tell&mdash;told all he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; the old man grunted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back.
Daego&rsquo;s got him hid out somewhere. Wouldn&rsquo;t quite
dare kill him outright. Leastwise, I don&rsquo;t think so.
Can&rsquo;t tell about that half-caste strain in his blood,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come back,&rdquo; echoed Pant, &ldquo;but meantime
we&rsquo;ve got to carry on the work. &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t do to
disappoint Johnny when he comes back. We got to
get all this red lure down by the water ready for the
trip down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s worse,&rdquo; said Hardgrave, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to
do just what you said a minute ago; keep old Daego
guessing. Don&rsquo;t like his taking up more men. Looks
bad. May come over here like a young army any
time, bent on driving us out. Got any place for this?&rdquo;
He pointed at his miscellaneous cargo stacked on the
bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to use Johnny&rsquo;s office, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, Gesippio, a Carib who bunked
close to the office, said to his work mate, &ldquo;There
was devil doin&rsquo;s in that office of Johnny&rsquo;s last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil doin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil doin&rsquo;s! First the whole place was lit up
like it was busting with flames. Seemed like every
crack was shootin&rsquo; flames. Then all was dark again.
Pretty soon there came a blue blaze, sort of low-like,
and a hissin&rsquo; sound like the old Serpent, the Evil One,
might o&rsquo; made. Then all of a sudden, sendin&rsquo; me all
of a heap, there came a most terrible bang. After
that I didn&rsquo;t hear no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time on the cabin that had been Johnny&rsquo;s
office was kept carefully locked day and night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S DEATH AN&rsquo; DESTRUCTION&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Having barely escaped dropping into the jaws of
an alligator, Johnny Thompson wound his leg about
his vine rope at a spot where a knotty projection
would give him partial support, then proceeded to
make a sad survey of the situation. There was the
cocoanut tree, and there the alligator. There were
two other &rsquo;gators floating silently on the surface of
the pool. To land there was out of the question.
There might be a landing place on the other side of
that particular rocky formation. It was his only
chance.</p>
<p>After climbing the vine, a slow and painful process,
he made a hasty survey. Already it was growing
dark. There was need of haste, but the dull stupor
of the tropics was still upon him. He could not hasten.
He found it necessary to make his way over the jagged
rocks for some distance before finding a safe fastening
for his vine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>When at last all was secure the sun had gone down
and a dark bank of clouds again obscured the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got&rsquo;a hurry,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Got to get down
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did go down rapidly until he had all but reached
the rocky ledge upon which he was to land. There,
for a time, he lost his courage. His late experience
had unnerved him. What sort of landing was this
which he now approached? It is difficult to distinguish
a motionless alligator from a rocky surface
even in broad daylight. How impossible in the dusk!
So he clung there motionless, trying to stare into the
half darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&mdash;can&rsquo;t hang here forever,&rdquo; he breathed at
last. &ldquo;Here goes, and here&rsquo;s hoping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his great joy he landed safely on a high and
dry rock, quite free from danger.</p>
<p>But at once there arose the problem of finding his
way to the cocoanut tree. After a half hour of groping
about, he uttered a shout of joy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There it is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>There indeed was the tree, and at the top of it
were the cocoanuts&mdash;three ripe ones and many green
ones. The problem of securing the food was still before
him. At close sight of the tree his heart sank.
It was taller and larger than he thought&mdash;fifteen feet
high and a foot through at the base. What was worse,
the circle of great fern-like leaves that grew between
him and the nuts appeared to present a solid barrier
through which it was going to be difficult to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m weak from hunger,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;From
hunger and something else. I&rsquo;d rather lie down and
sleep than climb that tree, but I must try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did try. Three times he climbed to that green
barrier; three times tried to break his way through the
ring of branches to the fruit; fought there until cold
perspiration stood out upon his brow and his knees
shook so he could scarcely support himself; then each
time slid slowly down.</p>
<p>The last time, with something very much like a
sob, he threw himself upon the bare rocks and cried
passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>That night, on the surface of the highest rock he
could find, with no fire, with only the glittering stars
above him, he slept the deep sleep of utter exhaustion.
From time to time as he slept there came sounds of
scratches on the rock above him, of grunts and other
sounds in the darkness; but no wild thing dared approach
too close to this strange smelling creature from
another world.</p>
<p>The three days that followed that night on the
rocks beside the falls were like a long drawn out evil
dream. True, Fate dropped him a comforting morsel.
One of the cocoanuts, a small one, had fallen during
the night. With fingers that shook, Johnny bored a
hole through one eye of it and drank the milk eagerly;
drank to the last drop. Then he broke the nut on a
rock and gnawed at the rich, white meat until not a
shred was left.</p>
<p>Lacking strength and courage to build a second
raft, he began making his way as best he could, now
on hands and knees and now flat on his stomach,
over the low, narrow game trail that followed the
bank of the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>As the heat of the day beat its way through the
tangled forest he began to feel faint. Now and again,
as he paused to rest, he felt that he must be losing
consciousness.</p>
<p>A great desire to sleep came over him. Nothing
much mattered. A strange peace, the drowsy, drug-like
peace of the tropics, lulled him to rest. Now
he slept, defenseless in the open trail. And now he
woke to journey on. When night came he could not
rightly tell. In that gloom there was no day. In
time he woke to find all dark about him. Still he
struggled on.</p>
<p>The scream of parrots, the senseless chatter of
monkeys, the roar of beasts of prey, all were the same
to him, for all came faint and indistinct as in a dream.</p>
<p>Once he fought with a great spotted beast. A
jaguar, perhaps. Or was that, too, only a dream?
He could not tell. He seemed to wake from a horrible
nightmare of claws and wild snarls to find his
arms and chest torn and bleeding and his knife gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have fought with my knife and lost
it in the struggle,&rdquo; was his mental comment.</p>
<p>He did not feel badly about that, nor did he search
for it long. Nothing seemed to trouble him. Great
waves of dreams swept over him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>His lips were dry and parched. &ldquo;Fever. Malaria.
That mosquito did it,&rdquo; he told himself. That did not
matter, either. Nothing mattered.</p>
<p>He dragged himself to the bank of the stream to
cleanse his wounds. He drank long and deeply. A
small fish, darting too close, was caught in his hand.
This he devoured whole.</p>
<p>Other things of the jungle he ate&mdash;strange fruits,
nuts and roots. Were they poison? It did not matter.
Nothing mattered.</p>
<p>So, every day growing weaker, he came at the
end of the third day to something very much like an
abandoned clearing. Such it was, but he was too far
lost in his drowsy sleep to know it. He had passed
half through it when, of a sudden, he came upon a
hut, a palm-thatched, forlorn and deserted hut. Yet,
to him in his delirium of fever it was something far
greater than an abandoned hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;Home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throwing himself across the threshold, he fell
prone in the dust of the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>A great lizard, sleeping in the corner, awoke and
darted away; a small bird, whose nest was in the
thatch, scolded shrilly. But Johnny heard nothing,
saw nothing.</p>
<p>When at last he summoned up strength enough to
drag himself to a corner and upon a bed of rotting
mats, he murmured again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home! Home! How good to be home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the deserted cabin was dampness, mold and
desolation. Only one overwrought by peril and trouble,
or made delirious by a burning fever, could have
thought of it as home. Home? Here there was
neither water, food nor friends.</p>
<p>Once, having come out of his delirium, he managed
to grope about until he had found a mouldy
gourd. With this in hand he dragged himself on hands
and knees to the river. Here in his eagerness for
water he all but pitched head-foremost into the stream.
As it was, he left a print of his hand in the plastic
ooze on the bank.</p>
<p>The gourd he filled with water. Having spilled
most of it on the way back, in a fever of haste lest
the rest escape, he drank it greedily, then sank back
on his musty little bed to dream delirious dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>In his dreams, with Pant by his side, he pursued
a red gleam that, while growing brighter, appeared
always to elude them. &ldquo;The red lure. The red
lure!&rdquo; he repeated over and over.</p>
<p>Next morning found him too weak to rise or to
think. He had only strength to breathe. He could
only stare helplessly at the dull brown roof of the
hut and hope for things that never come.</p>
<p>But now the scene was changed. Instead of the
smell of decay all about him, there was the perfume
of apple blossoms. Over his head the white and pink
glory of Springtime blended with white patches of
sunshine. Beneath him was a soft bed of grass; above
him apple trees and sky. From far and near came
the warble of thrushes, the chirp of robins, the shrill
challenge of woodpeckers. He was once more in the
orchard that witnessed his boyhood. Buried deep in
clover, he was sensing the joy of Spring.</p>
<p>Then the hot light of a new day dragged him back
to waking consciousness. Dreams vanished. Dull
reality hung about him. He tried to lift himself
upon an elbow. He failed. Could he lift a hand?
He could not. His eyes closed from the mere force
of this effort, and remained closed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The hand of Johnny Thompson, that manly right
hand that had scorned to strike one weaker than its
owner; the hand that had so often inspired the dishonest,
the unkind, mean and criminal to a wholesome
fear; the hand that had never been employed in
mere selfish ends, was powerless and still.</p>
<p>The stream rushing past that cabin seemed a funeral
train, powerful and free, ready to carry that
brave spirit away. Some strange bird sang a song
from the tree tops. Its notes, measured and slow,
were like a dirge.</p>
<p>A great snake, attracted by the dry warmth of the
doorway, curled up there in the dust to sleep. The
figure on the cot did not move. A great lizard crept
in through a rotted corner to gaze blinking at him.
The snake, sensing a dinner, slowly uncoiled, then
with a motion surprisingly quick for a creature of
its kind, darted, forked tongue flashing, at the lizard.
There was a scurry of feet, a gliding scrape. Lizard
and snake passed within a few inches of that
prostrate head. The snake passed over the motionless
hand, yet the hand did not stir, the eyes did not
open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The rush of waters, the distant mournful notes of
birds, the sigh of the wind through the palms seemed
to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead! Dead! Dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Pant would not believe that Johnny was dead.
&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t have done him in,&rdquo; he said to Hardgrave.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing that really can&rsquo;t be done. Burly
Russians; treacherous, slant-eyed Yellow men have
tried it; yes, and daring white crooks, too. These
didn&rsquo;t get Johnny, so why should a mere Spanish
half-caste succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he would not admit that Johnny was dead; but
as days passed and he did not return he grew more
and more restless. Each morning strengthened his
determination to discover what had happened to his
good pal. Each evening found him with some more
daring plan for discovering his whereabouts. When
sending his men as spies among Daego&rsquo;s men at night
failed, he took to paddling across the river and drifting
in and out among them in the dark himself. This
was exceedingly dangerous business. He might be
discovered, and if he were he would doubtless go the
way of his pal, whatever way that might be. He
was careless of danger; any risk was not too great,
could he but find Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>It was during one of his secret visits to the enemy&rsquo;s
camp that an exceedingly strange thing happened.</p>
<p>It was a hot, sultry night. Daego&rsquo;s men lay about
on mats before the huts. The murmur of voices constantly
hung upon the air. Now and again there came
a shout of laughter from some black man. Half the
workers were blacks from Belize. The others were
Spaniards. These seldom laughed.</p>
<p>At times, when the hum of voices ceased and
laughter died away, from out of the bush there came
the hoarse call of a jaguar, and who could say it was
not the &ldquo;killer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant had dropped upon a mat at the edge of a
group of black men. In the shadows no man could
see his neighbor&rsquo;s face. No questions were asked.
The moon, just rising over the edge of the jungle, cast
long shadows and sent ghost-like shimmers of light
across the patches of mist that rose from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>The hum of voices was at its loudest. A black
man, close to Pant, was in the midst of a loud guffaw
when, of a sudden, the laugh appeared to freeze in
his throat. This sound, or sudden cessation of sound,
so unusual and so apparently without cause, spread
silence like a blanket over the clearing.</p>
<p>Out of that silence there rose a hoarse, high-pitched
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Look up a-yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who spoke was the one who had so suddenly
ceased laughing. His outstretched arm, clad
as it was in a white sleeve of cotton stuff, was like a
white pointer with a black tip pointing toward the
sky.</p>
<p>What Pant saw as he followed the line of that
pointer made even his blood run cold and set the hair
at the back of his head standing on end. The moonlight
playing across the sky had caught something
white and faintly luminous that floated on air well
above the tree tops. Even as he watched, the thing
seemed to assume the form of a white-robed figure.
The head began to come out with glimmering brightness.
Eyes appeared, and the semblance of a mouth.
Then, as the whole company, far and near, lay
wrapped in silence, there sounded such a rattling as
one may sometimes fancy he hears in passing a graveyard
at the dead of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! My Massa!&rdquo; groaned the black man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a ghost, the ghost of that white boy Daego drove
into the bush. He&rsquo;s come back to ha&rsquo;nt us. It&rsquo;s death
an&rsquo; destruction! Destruction for Daego; and death
for all of us. Oh! My Massa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a murmuring &ldquo;Uh-huh&rdquo; from many
voices. Then from a dark corner there rose the chant
of the only Carib of the crew. He was singing the
native song of his people&mdash;the Devil Song that is
supposed to drive out evil spirits. Weird and fantastic
as his song was, the thing that floated above
the tree tops was far more weird.</p>
<p>Over in another corner Pant heard a shuffling of
feet. Someone was moving away, going toward the
river. Fearing that they might find his dugout and
so rob him of his means of returning to his own
camp, he went skulking along after them. There
were five or six black men in the group. Since they
were not approaching his boat, he followed close
enough to hear what they were saying. Arriving at
the river bank, they pushed a long dugout into the
water and with scarcely a sound leaped in and shoved
away from the shore. A moment later, keeping to
the shadows, the boy heard:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come daylight we&rsquo;s far down this haunted river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yea-bo!&rdquo; came back in answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s death an&rsquo; destruction. I knowd twa&rsquo;nt no
sense afoolin&rsquo; with them thar white ha&rsquo;nts,&rdquo; gloomed
another.</p>
<p>There was silence after that. The only sound was
the dip-lip of paddles, but Pant had heard enough to
make his heart glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s ghost,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Five men
gone already, and more will follow; perhaps many
more. Not so bad for a ghost,&rdquo; and he laughed
softly to himself.</p>

<p>Palms that hung over the silent, swiftly flowing
stream murmured and sighed. Their murmuring and
sighing was as sad as the voice of pines and hemlocks
in a graveyard on a winter&rsquo;s night. Sadder still was
the strange wail of some tropical bird, piping always
on the same minor key. On the bed of decaying mats
in the abandoned cabin where little lizards ran in
and out, Johnny Thompson lay white and motionless.</p>
<p>Came an hour when there fell upon all this gloom
a shrill discordant note. The scream of a wild parrot
broke the drowsy silence. This was answered by
another, and yet another, until all up and down the
stream the air was filled with harsh, discordant music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>The innocent cause of all this disturbance was a
fantastically painted dugout, all striped and spotted
with red, blue, green and white. Its prow and stern
rose high out of the water like the ancient crafts of
the Vikings.</p>
<p>Forward sat a girl, aft was a boy, and in the middle
sat a large native Carib woman. So brown and
rugged was the girl that she might easily have been
taken for a Spaniard. A second look revealed deep-set
freckles, a glow of color, a mass of curly hair,
and an indefinable air of confidence and frankness
that could belong only to an Anglo-Saxon. This girl,
Jean McQueen, was Scotch. The boy was her
brother. Just over from England, where he had attended
school for years, he had the attire, the manners
and the color of a perfect young English gentleman.
In his tweed nickers and his smart sport
shirt, he seemed quite as much out of place in the
wilderness as his sister in her patched and faded khaki
suit seemed at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not the creek,&rdquo; the boy said. There was
impatience in his tone, and something that suggested
fear. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be, Rod. We&rsquo;ll go on a little farther.&rdquo;
Brushing aside a low-hanging palm leaf, the girl
seized her paddle to send the light craft forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>For a space of ten minutes nothing might be heard
save the dip-dip of their paddles and the scream of
parrots over their heads.</p>
<p>Suddenly the boat swerved to the right shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abandoned, I guess,&rdquo; said the girl, sweeping the
clearing with her eyes. &ldquo;Might tell us something,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some sort of old cabin over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s here&mdash;or
has been in the last few days.&rdquo; She pointed
to a well-defined hand print in the half-dried mud
of the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubber hunters, perhaps, or a chiclero. Let&rsquo;s
go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy hung back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t afraid, are you?&rdquo; the girl laughed. It
was a rich, free, melodious laugh. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to hurt you in this wilderness. C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>She led the way over the trail which Johnny on
his journey to the creek for water had made. The
boy followed, reluctantly, and the Carib woman waddled
along behind. More than once the girl paused
to examine with a practiced eye patches of grass that
lay flat down as if some wild creature had slept there.
These were the spots where Johnny had fallen and
found himself too weak to rise at once.</p>
<p>A little cry of dismay escaped the girl&rsquo;s lips as
her eyes fell upon the white-faced, prostrate form on
the decaying mats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; her lips framed the word she did not
speak. Death to this girl who knew so much of life,
and loved it so, was a terrifying thing, thrice terrible
in the heart of a wilderness. Yet here was a boy, a
boy of her own race, who, to all appearances, had died
here alone in this abandoned hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How&mdash;how awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some little lizards scampered over the dry palm
leaves as her foot stirred the dust at the door. In
another moment she was bending over the prostrate
form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you can&rsquo;t always tell.&rdquo; There was a note
of hope in her tone. &ldquo;Rod, bring some water, quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>During the dragging moments of her brother&rsquo;s absence
she studied the prostrate boy&rsquo;s face. There are
lines in one&rsquo;s face which to the keen observer tells
the story of his life. Has he been kind and thoughtful
of others? Has he lived brave and clean? It is
written there. Has he been harsh, impatient, careless,
dissipated even in small ways? This, too, is recorded
there. As the girl read the story of Johnny&rsquo;s
life she found herself hoping more and more that
she might save him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; she whispered as her brother appeared
with the canteen.</p>
<p>With trembling fingers she placed the mouth of
the canteen to the boy&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed. Then of a sudden
the wrinkle of anxiety on the girl&rsquo;s brow disappeared.
Johnny&rsquo;s lips moved in an inarticulate murmur.</p>
<p>With a little exclamation of joy the girl sprang
to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lives! He lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then all was silent again on stream and jungle.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was a strangely mixed dream through which
Johnny was passing. It seemed night. He was hidden
away in some deep forest. A storm had set the
tree tops to twisting and writhing. The constant roll
of thunder, mingled with the moaning of the trees,
made the night hideous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Like a flash the scene changed. It was day&mdash;Sunday
in the little old church at home. Someone rose
to sing; a beautiful white-gowned figure with a sweet
melodious voice. She sang, but the words of the song
had no meaning for him. It was as if they were
sung in a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>And now he was gazing upon a sunrise. Such a
sunrise as is never seen on land or sea, all red, orange
and gold.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of this last broken dream that
he opened his eyes and stared around him.</p>
<p>To his vast amazement he saw that the vision of
orange and gold had not completely vanished. Neither
had the singing nor the sound of thunder been hushed.
They had merely taken on a more definite form, a
truer meaning. The words of the song:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ne-ha aba ne ha aba muta,</p>
<p class="t">Sagmuk labsa abona</p>
<p class="t0">Sag aba don,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>were not entirely strange to him, but they had no
real meaning for him. He had heard his Caribs sing
them around his camp fire. They were the words of
a strange native song. As for the thunder, it was
merely the wild beating of a barrel drum. And the
flash of orange and gold was a girl, a very beautiful
girl, swaying gracefully in a sort of rhythmic exercise
to the beating of the drum.</p>
<p>He stared in unbelieving astonishment. The thing
was not real. He was still dreaming. He tried to
put up a hand to rub the illusion away, but finding
this difficult because of weakness, contented himself
with staring about the room where the golden vision
continued to sway and whirl and the reverberating
drum shook dust from the ceiling.</p>
<p>Slowly familiar objects came to view. The roof
of the palm thatched cabin looked familiar. He had
lain beneath it some time. That might have been
long ago, or was it yesterday? He remembered the
holes in the roof. The holes, one had been triangular,
another round. The spots were still there, but instead
of sunlight streaming through, the holes were
covered by a fresh green palm leaf thatch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>He looked again at the swaying spot of gold that
was the girl. The girl seemed almost real. Her face
was flushed. It would be, if she swayed to music in
such a clime. The black woman, like an ebony statue,
sat beating the drum as she sang:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ne-ha aba ne ha aba muta.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then a sudden thought struck Johnny. The dancing
girl was not black; she was not golden-brown
like the Indian, not the brown of the Mexican, either.
She was white like himself. A very comely white
girl she was, too; red cheeks, tossing curly hair,
freckles, slightly turned-up nose&mdash;a real girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dream,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;A white girl
in the heart of this wilderness? I&rsquo;m dead. This is
Heaven. She&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wanted to laugh at this last, but did not dare.
It might break the spell! The girl was too robust,
too red-cheeked for an angel. Whoever heard of a
freckle-faced angel? But whoever heard of a real
white girl in such a spot?</p>
<p>The mats looked real, too. What of those on
which he lay? He ran his fingers over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New, too,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Things were coming back to him. He had walked
a long way, crept farther, dragged himself to this
cabin. Here, after one try at bringing water, he had
lain himself down to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently I&rsquo;m not dead,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;These people must have arrived to save me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and tried to think. In the process
he fell asleep.</p>
<p>What had happened was this. Having found
Johnny dying of fever there in the abandoned hut, the
girl, Jean, had insisted upon abandoning all plans for
their future except the business of bringing him back
to life. To this end the native Carib woman had
searched the jungle for such herbs as have long been
used by her people for curing a fever. To this same
end, brother and sister had searched that same forest
for birds that would provide broth and for fruits to
supply refreshing drink for the invalid.</p>
<p>The strange music and the rythmic motion that
accompanied it was the idea of the Carib woman. Did
she attach some wild native religious significance to
it? Who can tell? The boy had made the drum
from a deer&rsquo;s skin and a hollow log; the girl had
joined in merely to please the Carib woman and satisfy
her simple soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Native medicine, the jungle&rsquo;s nourishment, the
black woman&rsquo;s wild music, the white girl&rsquo;s tender
care, all these in their way had helped. When Johnny
woke the second time he was well on his way to recovery.</p>
<p>It is one thing to lie alone, helpless and dying in a
wretched cabin in the heart of a wilderness; quite another
to find one&rsquo;s self surrounded by true friends,
none the less real because they are new, and to feel
strength and life coursing back into one&rsquo;s veins.</p>
<p>At first Johnny asked few questions. Asking questions
had never been his way of discovering the truth.
He looked on with astonishment at the things that
went on around him. The wilderness which to him
had been a land of famine was suddenly as if by magic
turned into a Garden of Eden. Early in the morning
he heard the pop of a light rifle somewhere in the
brush. At night he drank such broth and ate such
tender shreds of meat as had never passed his lips before.
The strange, glorious girl vanished for an hour,
to return with yellow melons, melons that grew on
trees,&mdash;&ldquo;pawpaw&rdquo; she called it. She brought water
that was sweet and fresh, not from the hot stream, but
from a vine torn from a tree where it clung. A hundred
other miracles were wrought for his comfort and
healing. And all the time, as if by magic, strength
came back to him. On the fourth day he walked a
bit unsteadily, but quite confidently, out of the cabin
to sit on a mahogany log with a cabbage tree for a
back support. Here he sat and watched dreamily the
golden girl who, at this moment dressed in her humblest
garb of faded khaki, was bending over a native
mahogany wash bowl, found somewhere in the cabin,
washing clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Engaged in this task, with her thick, curly hair
drawn up in a tight knot at the top of her head, with
her brown arms flaked with suds, she seemed real
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No angel,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;just a real girl; a
whole lot better!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I wonder where
they came from, and where they were going when
they found me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, had he asked the girl this last
question she would have been obliged to answer: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The truth was that the Scotch girl and her brother
were quite as lost in this wilderness as he and quite as
eager to find their way out.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime the strange doings, the flashes of
phosphorescent light and strange noises, continued behind
the locked door of Johnny&rsquo;s office at the camp
on Rio Hondo. In spite of this, however, the Caribs
continued to work faithfully at their tasks and the
work of getting out the red lure went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making fine progress,&rdquo; said Hardgrave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pant, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be able to show a fine
profit. That is,&rdquo; his brow wrinkled, &ldquo;if we can take
it out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make it. Never fear.&rdquo; said Hardgrave.
&ldquo;Daego&rsquo;s getting worried. Another pit-pan load of
his blacks went down the river last night. Wait and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ghost,&rdquo; smiled Pant.</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, though Johnny in his far
away jungle hut was greatly improved in health, his
ghost walked nightly upon the sky above the timber
that faced Daego&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Every night, too, Pant slipped across the river to
join the enemy&rsquo;s camp and to catch the drift of events.
He found that these Central Americans, black and
brown alike, had a great fear of ghosts, particularly
of white ghosts. Johnny&rsquo;s ghost hovering there near
the clouds threw some into near hysteria and sent
others hurrying down the river.</p>
<p>It was easy to see, they explained, why this white
ghost hovered above the tree tops. The hot and humid
air close to the earth in the jungle has always been
hated and feared by the white man. Above the trees
the air is fresh and crisp. Why, then, should any
ghost descend to earth?</p>
<p>But despite the fact that he did not descend, his
presence above them meant that in time pestilence, a
death-dealing fever, a destructive storm or a flood
would descend upon the camp and wipe it from the
face of the earth.</p>
<p>One person did not believe in the ghost&mdash;Daego.
He raved and stormed at his men. Day and night, as
if searching for something, he haunted the banks of
the river. More than once Pant barely escaped being
discovered by him. In spite of all this, however, the
ghost appeared promptly on schedule and Daego&rsquo;s
ranks grew thinner and thinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up, dear ghost,&rdquo; Pant whispered, &ldquo;keep
it up, and in time we&rsquo;ll have nothing to fear from
Daego. Oh!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;if only Johnny were here
to enjoy it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Johnny was far away in the palm leaf thatched
cabin on a stream that was as strange to those who
had battled for his life as it was to him.</p>
<p>And then one night Johnny&rsquo;s ghost vanished into
thin air.</p>
<p>Before that happened, however, there were many
other strange doings on the upper stretches of Rio
Hondo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />PROVISIONED FOR A LONG JOURNEY</h2>
<p>Ten days after his discovery there in the abandoned
cabin, Johnny Thompson was ready to travel. He
was ready to embark in the dugout of his new found
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be long,&rdquo; he assured Jean, &ldquo;before
I will be able to do my bit with the paddle, to assist
you in going wherever you wish to go.&rdquo; Where
that might be he had not the slightest notion.</p>
<p>One thing puzzled him. As they prepared to leave
the cabin, the dugout was loaded fore and aft with
food supplies. In the prow, carefully wrapped in
green palm leaves, were the carcasses of two young
peccaries, killed that very morning. Piled on top
of these were three or four dozen ripe cocoanuts. In
the stem were casabas (great potato-like vegetables),
tree melons, breadfruit, and a basket filled with strange
little red tomatoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rations for a week,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;How far from
home are these people, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was soon enough to know. Hardly had the dugout,
with Roderick in the stem as steersman, been
pushed from the shore and allowed to take a downstream
course, than the girl, turning upon Johnny
one of her most wonderful smiles, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think we know where we&rsquo;re going;
but we don&rsquo;t. We only know we&rsquo;re on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&mdash;don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; Johnny
gasped in astonishment. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s brow wrinkled for a second,
then the smile came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake,&rdquo; said Johnny, solemnly stretching forth
a hand. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second their hands met Then, as a swirling
eddy set the boat whirling, the girl seized a paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said quietly as they reached more
placid water, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t tell you while you were ill;
afraid it would disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have,&rdquo; said Johnny. Quite suddenly
something had come to him. &ldquo;The red lure!&rdquo; he
murmured, quite unconscious of the fact that he spoke
out loud. &ldquo;When will I ever get back to it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the red lure?&rdquo; the girl asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red lure? Why, that&rsquo;s my pet name for
mahogany, the prince of priceless woods. If you&rsquo;ve
ever seen the mirror-like gleam of its polished surface,
if you&rsquo;ve seen how like a fire on the hearth at
sunset it is, you know what it means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. I do,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been given an opportunity
to bring down a sample, one boom full, a hundred
thousand feet or so of that matchless wood from a
forest the value of which can scarcely be estimated. I
had made a fine start, too, when I was suddenly driven
into the bush. I promptly got myself lost, and here
I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading intense interest in her eyes, he told her the
whole story of his adventure thus far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he ended with an uncertain smile,
&ldquo;it seems that we&mdash;you, your brother and I&mdash;are all
babes in the woods, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s not quite as bad as that,&rdquo; said Jean.
&ldquo;Bad enough, though. You see, I&rsquo;ve always lived in
the tropics with my father. He brought me here
when I was five. My brother, who is three years
older, was left behind in England.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a lot of things, my father has,&mdash;bananas,
cocoanuts, grapefruit. Just now he is gathering
chicle up a lost river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four months ago Rod came to us. The jungle
is all new to him. He was quite wild about it. So we
went on little exploring trips. I love it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like it,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all new up in this country. If ever a white
man set foot on it he&rsquo;s forgot it long ago. You cut
your way through a jungle, you find a stream, you
launch your dugout, which you&rsquo;ve dragged after you,
and you drift on and on through a land that white
men have never seen. It&rsquo;s wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo;
She closed her eyes as if in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous, too,&rdquo; she exclaimed, suddenly
starting up. &ldquo;You may get lost. We did. One
night we slept in the bottom of our dugout&mdash;Rod,
old Midge and I. When morning came we found
ourselves drifting in the center of a great river. What
do you think of that? Go to sleep in a stream you can
all but reach across, and wake in a broad river.
Magic, wouldn&rsquo;t you call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No magic about it, though. A thing had happened
to our tie rope. Some creature had gnawed it
square off. And there we were, drifting down a
great black silent river we had never seen before.
What were we to do? What would you have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to find my way back to the mouth of the
little stream from which I had drifted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just what we attempted. That&rsquo;s how
we found you. The mouth of every stream looked
alike to us, so all we could do was to go up each one
a short way until we knew it was the wrong stream.
We had about decided that this was the wrong stream,
too, when I discovered your hand print in the mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve spent all this time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderfully kind. That&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much in the tropics. Down here time
doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;ll find our way home sooner or
later. When we do I&rsquo;ll say: &lsquo;Hello, Dad. I&rsquo;m back,&rsquo;
and Dad will say, &lsquo;So I see, daughter, so I see.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So lightly did these words come tripping from her
lips, so rippling was the laughter following, that for
a moment Johnny was deceived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She means it, too,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;So this
is the way of the tropics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deception lasted for but one moment. The
wrinkle across her brow, the far away look in her eyes,
the irregular dip of her paddle, all told plainer than
words that she had been playing a part; that she was
concealing homesickness and hunger for friends; that
they might be days, even weeks, finding their way
back, and that in the meantime all her father&rsquo;s men
would be searching the streams and bush for her and
her brother.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this fresh revelation, their boat
suddenly shot from the creek into a mighty stream
of black and sullen waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rio Hondo!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And down this river is your camp,&rdquo; the girl said
quietly. &ldquo;We will take you there at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Johnny was tempted. He had been
away for more than two weeks. What had happened
in that time? What of Pant? What of his Caribs?
What of Daego and his men? Had there been a
battle? If so, who had won? Whose camp fires
gleamed there in the heart of that magic mahogany
forest, his own or Daego&rsquo;s? He did so want to know
the answer to all these questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>But suddenly there flashed through his mind the
worried face of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave girl!&rdquo; he breathed as a lump in his throat
all but choked him. &ldquo;She saved my life. It cost her
many days. She must go home. She&rsquo;s a girl. I&rsquo;m
a boy. I can&rsquo;t let them take me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he exclaimed, snatching the paddle from
her hands, &ldquo;there is time enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the paddle he deftly turned the boat about.
Then, nothing loath, Roderick and the black woman
joined him in the stroke that sent it speeding upstream.
So, once more, Johnny&rsquo;s back was turned on the red
lure.</p>
<p>That night Johnny dreamed once more of little
golden brown women grinding and spinning, of hunters
returning with deer and wild pigs slung across
their backs, and of the three gods,&mdash;one black, one
green and one of pure gold.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, when he awoke from this dream
he felt nearer the fabled Indian village; the dream
seemed more real than ever before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />A BRONZE BEAUTY</h2>
<p>Once more it was morning on the upper reaches of
Rio Hondo. The dugout was tied to the bared roots
of a gnarled old mangrove. The camp of Jean and
Johnny, of Rod and the Carib woman, was on the
crest of a high bank that overlooked the black waters.</p>
<p>The aged Carib woman was frying cakes made
from casabas ground to powder and mixed with
water. Jean was frying slices of meat from the ham
of a peccary. Johnny was engaged in the business of
making coffee. After his first demonstration this had
been his allotted task.</p>
<p>While the coffee was now coming to a boil, he sat
alternating gazing away at the swift flowing waters
and looking dreamily at the golden girl whose hair
was glorified by a touch of sunrise mingled with the
glow of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine chance she&rsquo;s got of finding her way home,&rdquo;
he thought. They had searched all the previous day
for the right creek. &ldquo;There are a hundred creeks.
They don&rsquo;t know how long they drifted nor how far.
Not a chance. Have to be some other way. Some
of her father&rsquo;s men may come upon us, or we might
go back to camp. Someone there might know the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was meditating on the advisability of proposing
this last course when there came a sudden excited
shout from the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roderick!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;Something has
happened to him.&rdquo; For a moment the camp was in
commotion, then the Scotch boy came bounding out
of the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean! Jean!&rdquo; he shouted, seizing her by the
shoulders and waltzing her about. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a trail,
a hard-beaten trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Old Portage,&rdquo; the girl cried breathlessly.
&ldquo;The trail that leads to home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Suddenly crumpling up in her tracks, she sank to
the ground and hid her face in her hands. Unmoved
as she had been through all this strange and trying
adventure, now as the end appeared at hand she was
for a moment just a girl with the heart of a girl and
a girl&rsquo;s way of shedding tears in times of great joy or
deep sorrow. And who would not like her the better
for it?</p>
<p>The Old Portage, the brother and sister informed
Johnny, was a trail used alike by Mexicans and Indians.
The trail led from Rio Hondo to the upper
waters of their own river, the one on which their
father&rsquo;s camp was located. Neither had been over
this trail, but their father had. He had told them of
passing over it. It was an old, old trail, he had explained,
which might have been in existence at the
time of the Spanish conquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be a bit of doubt about its being
the trail,&rdquo; said Roderick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard-packed
and old that it seems made of cement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our trail!&rdquo; the girl rejoiced. &ldquo;By to-night,
or to-morrow noon at most, we will be home. And
you?&rdquo; she said suddenly turning to Johnny.</p>
<p>The question startled him. It had not occurred to
him that there was a possible parting of the ways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be going back to your camp, of course,&rdquo;
said Roderick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite welcome to our dugout.
You may have an opportunity to send it back.
We may pass your way. It&rsquo;s no matter. What&rsquo;s a
dugout? You&rsquo;ll be in your camp by night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, to his own great stupefaction, Johnny
did not pause to reason why, but simply said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, since I&rsquo;ve come this far, I believe I&rsquo;ll see you
home.&rdquo; He looked straight at the golden girl as he
spoke. Had he but known it, he was taking a rather
large contract.</p>
<p>Roderick looked surprised. The girl looked Johnny
frankly in the eye and said: &ldquo;That will be very kind
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not hard to see that she had greater faith
in the skill and courage of this new found friend than
she had in her brother who, though educated in the
way of books, was ignorant enough when it came to
river lore and the ways of the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>A half hour later, after dragging the dugout to a
safe place on the bank, they prepared packs for a
land journey. Johnny tried to think what it had been
that had caused him to make the decision which must
take him deeper into the jungle and farther from his
camp. Other than a vague feeling that the girl who
had saved his life might yet need his protection, he
could discover no motive whatsoever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sense to it,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;not a bit in the
world. But what&rsquo;s the fun of always having a reason
for things, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A boy&rsquo;s will is a wind&rsquo;s will, and the thoughts
of youth are long, long thoughts,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated as he
strapped his pack to his shoulders and prepared to
follow his companions through the brush to the hard
beaten ancient trail.</p>
<p>It was strange, but the trail they followed that day
did not seem quite like a portage trail leading from
one river to another. At least it did not seem so to
Johnny, not from the very start. At first his feelings
on this subject were based on nothing tangible. As
the day passed and still they plodded onward, he could
have given reasons. He did not give them. What
was the use? Time would tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>They crossed no streams, yet they were not following
the backbone of a ridge. That in itself was
strange. They carried two canteens. These were soon
emptied. Had it not been for Jean&rsquo;s admirable knowledge
of tropical vegetation they might have suffered
from thirst. A vine growing close beside the trail,
which Jean called Bejuco, filled their canteens while
they rested.</p>
<p>At noon they paused for a light lunch. Mid-afternoon
found them plodding upward; indeed, almost
the whole day had showed them a slight up-grade trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should be coming to the divide,&rdquo; Johnny said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we should.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s brow was wrinkled
in thought. &ldquo;Father never spoke of the divide, but
there must be one. That&rsquo;s the place where you stop
going up, and start going down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must come to it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they did not.</p>
<p>Four o&rsquo;clock found them resting beside a pool. A
very strange pool it was. Circular, with moss and
ferns growing to its very brink, its water clear as air,
it seemed like a great funnel set in the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if there had been a sudden cave-in,&rdquo; said Jean.</p>
<p>Stranger still, they found on the side next to the
trail four crude stone steps leading down to the brink
of the pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear your father speak of this
pool?&rdquo; asked Johnny.</p>
<p>Neither Jean nor her brother had heard of it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; thought Johnny to himself, &ldquo;is not the
portage. It is some other trail. But what trail can
it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkness found them still plodding upward. Loath
to spend the night without water, at Jean&rsquo;s direction
the boys sought out a tree known as the &ldquo;kerosene
tree.&rdquo; A match applied to a piece of this wood transforms
it into a torch.</p>
<p>They had not gone far before the light of their
torch was reflected by water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another pool,&rdquo; said Roderick, settling down upon
the mosses that grew beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we camp,&rdquo; said Johnny, holding out his
torch that they might get a more perfect view of the
pool.</p>
<p>It was very much the same as the other, only
larger. The stone steps were not lacking, and beside
them was a pillar of stone on which Johnny&rsquo;s sensitive
fingers traced some very definite carvings of
strange animals and men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A relic of old Maya days,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See this pillar beside the steps; the pool itself?
Ever read about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Built by Mayas, I believe. Interesting people.
Hardgrave loaned me a book about them; the report
of some ethnological society. It reads like one of
Dumas&rsquo; novels. Tell you about them later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon busy preparing camp for the night.</p>
<p>Two hours later, with the still waters of the pool
reflecting the red glow of a half burned out campfire,
with Roderick stretched out on the mosses fast
asleep and the Carib woman nodding beneath a nut
palm, Johnny sat beside the girl and told of the wonders
of this land in the long ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the cocoanut palm in the shadows at
the far side of the pool?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think it grew there wild. So it did. But
how did it come there? Scholars say that its great,
great, great grandfather, centuries back, must have
been planted there, and that it may have grown beside
a palace.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whose palace?&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The palace of a Maya prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were there princes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Princes and great rulers; a mighty people once
lived here. Where this jungle now rules were cornfields,
cocoanut plantations, farms, homes, cities and
great temples, temples of stone, fifteen hundred feet
long, two hundred wide, two or three stories high.
That is the land of long ago, and now here is only
the jungle and this pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose this pool was here then?&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s hand was on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? There are pools in Palestine to-day
that were there two thousands years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if it could talk, what tales it could tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time they sat there in silence, each dreaming
the magic story in the fire and the deep, dark
pool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Long after the girl and the Carib woman had gone
to sleep in the shadows, Johnny sat there. In his
mind was a problem. They were on the wrong trail,
he was sure of that now. What trail? It was a
secret trail of some wild people, perhaps Mayas.
Whatever people they were, there was a city. Such
a hard beaten trail told of many travelers. What
should he do? All his life he had dreamed of discovering
a city, a city of lost people in some hidden
corner of the world. This, perhaps, was his chance.
For once the call of the red lure seemed faint and
far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three gods,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;one black, one green
and one of pure gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was Jean and her brother. They had
not guessed, at least Roderick had not. He was not
sure about Jean. They would discover the truth; too
late perhaps to turn back. Had he the right not to
warn them?</p>
<p>Long he pondered the problem. To go on alone
was out of the question. His recent experience had
given him an unconquerable fear of being alone in
the bush. Was it selfishness that in the end counciled
silence? Who can tell? At any rate, this was his
decision: they would go ahead until Jean or her
brother called a halt; when that would be he could
not guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Johnny spent that night beside the dying embers
of the camp fire. With legs doubled up beneath him,
arms stretched out before him, head hanging low, he
slept and sleeping dreamed again of golden brown
natives, and of black, green and gold gods.</p>
<p>In the midst of this dream he awoke. Or did
he awake? Did he but half awake? Was it reality
or dream? Whatever it was, he saw by the light of
the dying fire, on the opposite side of the pool where
the palm leaves parted, the face of a little brown man,
and above his head gleamed a spear. For an instant
he saw, or at least seemed to see him, then the palm
leaves silently swept together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he whispered, starting up.</p>
<p>He was wide awake now. Had he been awake before?
He dropped back into his place, but not to
sleep again. Now the rustle of palm leaves or the
snap of a twig aroused him, and now the long drawn
call of some beast of the jungle sent a thrill through
his being. But at last he slept, to dream no more
that night.</p>
<p>Morning found him the first one stirring. Jean
was his close second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a rocky ridge just up the trail,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Might be wild turkey up there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean nodded.</p>
<p>The next moment, with Roderick&rsquo;s light rifle,
Johnny was leading the way. After ten minutes&rsquo;
walking they came to a rocky ridge that led into the
jungle. Here the vegetation was thin. By climbing
a boulder, and creeping beneath a low-hanging palm,
they were able to make their way forward.</p>
<p>They had just crept forward for some distance
when, of a sudden, Johnny held up a finger of warning.
From somewhere ahead of them came a drumming
sound accompanied by a beating of wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turkey strut,&rdquo; Johnny whispered. &ldquo;C&rsquo;mon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together, scarcely breathing, they crept forward.
Suddenly rounding a pile of moss-grown rocks, they
saw the turkey.</p>
<p>It was a magnificent sight. Mounted upon a boulder
that served as a pedestal, the sun turning the touch
of bronze on his back to a plate of burnished gold
and his red comb to a fiery torch, was the most magnificent
wild gobbler Johnny had ever seen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>With a quick intake of breath, the girl touched
Johnny&rsquo;s arm. Without the slightest sound he moved
the rifle toward her. A shake of the head, a finger
pointed at the bird, told him to shoot.</p>
<p>His hand trembled slightly, but his aim was true.
A crack of the rifle was followed for a moment by a
mad beating of wings, then all was still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you got him,&rdquo; the girl exulted.</p>
<p>Leaping to her feet she sprang over the rocks to
at last find a seat upon the throne from which the
winged monarch had so lately fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;is what I call life. I&rsquo;ve
always lived in the wilds. I will always want to. I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to go back, back, back into the wilderness,
to discover something magnificent there. I
never knew exactly what that would be until last
night. When you told me last night of the Mayas
and their wonderful cities, I knew; a city, a magnificent
city filled with rare silks, jewels and gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny started. What was this? Did she know?
Would she follow the trail even though she knew it
to be the wrong one? Was she following a rainbow
to find the pot of gold?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All that happened long ago,&rdquo; he said, speaking
of the Mayas. &ldquo;The riches, glory, beauty and power
of their civilization perished centuries ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered as her head drooped with
disappointment. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;who
knows what is back of this wilderness? On the map
it is marked &lsquo;unexplored.&rsquo; It is unexplored. No white
man has ever been over&mdash;over&mdash;&rdquo; she caught herself
to stammer on, &ldquo;has been&mdash;been across this great
bush to the beyond. There may be&mdash;there must be
just one city, one gorgeous city left.&rdquo; Standing upon
the rock, she threw her arms wide as she exclaimed:
&ldquo;There must be! There must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would they go on over that trail to the great beyond?
What call could be stronger? What fear
could hinder? In vain Johnny told himself he must
go back, back to Pant and the red lure, back to fight
the treacherous Daego. All in vain. He owed it to
this magnificent girl&rsquo;s father to take her back. In
vain he recalled old Hardgrave&rsquo;s words: &ldquo;They
killed all white men who came to their camp except
me.&rdquo; They must go on. They would go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said the girl suddenly, &ldquo;we ought to
have some sort of&mdash;of signal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Signal?&rdquo; Johnny was puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Something one could shout or sing, if lost
from the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;I read a
story a short time ago. In that story the heroine
taught the hero a strange sort of song. I believe it
was called &lsquo;An Indian Love Song.&rsquo; Anyhow, the
first part, or prelude, went something like this:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t">Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t0">Whoo-hoo-hoo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Her clear voice rose high as she sang the notes. A
distant cliff caught them and threw them back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing it!&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>As best he could, Johnny repeated:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t">Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t0">Whoo-hoo-hoo.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then they had a good laugh over the broken echoes
that came back to them.</p>
<p>It all seemed very melodramatic and unreal to
Johnny then, but the time was to come when he would
cling to those notes as a drowning man to a spar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>By the light of the early morning sun they ate their
breakfast; by that same light resumed the trail that
led to the great unknown.</p>
<p>Roderick, who had lived his life on streets and in
houses, suspected nothing. The black woman, like
a slave, did not think. But the girl? She knew.
Every glance she sent back to Johnny told him that
she knew, and he gloried in her courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />PURRING SHADOWS</h2>
<p>As Johnny&rsquo;s interest in the red lure lost much of
its intensity, Pant&rsquo;s seemed to grow stronger. He
left no stone unturned if its turning would in any
way hinder the treacherous Daego and his band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s ghost is doing much,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not enough. There must be other ways of
annoying him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of Daego&rsquo;s black boats that moved by
night and of the stationary engine he had heard pop-popping
in the heart of the wilderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down there and look into that engine business,&rdquo;
he mused. &ldquo;There may be something to it,
something big. I&rsquo;ll go down to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>He left camp in his low, black dugout that night
and paddled swiftly down the river. For some time
he drove straight on; then of a sudden, as his keen
eye caught a speck of light that flashed on and then
blinked out like a match that is lighted and blown out,
he swerved to the shore, threw a rope over the low
limb of a mangrove, then sat there motionless, watching
the river.</p>
<p>His thoughts were of that Spanish half-caste,
Daego. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
man worth millions. If he never made another cent
and lived a thousand years he&rsquo;d never come to want.
Yet he&rsquo;s so greedy that he does crooked things that he
may gain more. If someone tries to break into the
mahogany or chicle business, instead of helping them
in a brotherly fashion as he could well afford to do,
he tries to throttle them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all in the
start one gets. If he starts out crooked, it doesn&rsquo;t
seem to matter much whether he succeeds or fails, he
remains crooked to the end. One would think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of a sudden his musings were cut short off. Something
was moving out there in the water. Something
like a shadow. Pant scarcely breathed as he watched
that long shadow until it had disappeared up a bend
in the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no shadow,&rdquo; he muttered as he sat up.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pit-pan, one of those dugouts the natives use
for coming on long journeys up the river. Must have
been sixty feet long. The most marvelous pit-pan
that ever was. Those pit-pans they used in other
days had at least a dozen men at the paddles. I didn&rsquo;t
see a single man, and still it moved straight on upstream.
Seems like I heard a purring sound. Surely
here is mystery&mdash;a purring shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardgrave spoke of Daego&rsquo;s black boats,&rdquo; he
said to himself. &ldquo;That thing must be one of them.
And there&rsquo;s nothing good about the thing they&rsquo;re up
to. Men don&rsquo;t go creeping up the river in the silence
of the night with an eel-like craft such as that for
nothing. If I can find out what it&rsquo;s all about and can
trap one of his pit-pans I&rsquo;ll be in a way to keep him
so busy he won&rsquo;t so much as have time to find out
when our raft starts down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>He arrived at the mouth of the creek, up which he
had located the pop-popping of a stationary engine
a half hour later. Taking a chance of being seen, he
began skirting the bushes at the edge of the creek.
For this move he was thankful. He had not gone a
mile when, upon rounding a cocoanut palm that overhung
the water, he came in sight of two long, dark
objects that lay close to shore, half concealed by
foliage. Seen from a little distance they resembled
nothing quite so much as great, black water snakes
asleep by the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pit-pans!&rdquo; he murmured as he came closer.</p>
<p>Pit-pans indeed they were, slender boats cut from
the trunk of a tree, sixty or more feet in length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blockade runners! Black devils!&rdquo; he muttered as
he passed. He dared not stop to inspect them. There
might be men on the bank, watching.</p>
<p>Soon he caught the pop-pop of that stationary engine
which had once so mystified him. This time,
instead of turning back, he paddled straight on. A
mile, two, three miles of water passed beneath his
craft. Still he moved steadily forward until, when
it seemed he must be almost upon the engine, he suddenly
discovered that the sound was behind and to
the right of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back in the bush,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Passed
the trail without seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning his boat about, he drifted slowly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There it is. Drift down thirty yards and hide
my boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This done, he struggled back along the bank to
the entrance of the path.</p>
<p>Following a winding trail, with the sound of the
motor growing louder, ever louder, with his heart
keeping tune to its throbbing, he made his way forward
until caution bade him slink into the shadows
of the great leaves of a cohune tree.</p>
<p>There, with only the ceaseless throb of the motor
to disturb his reflection, he had time to think things
through. How was this all to end? His men were
making progress, but Tivoli had told him that many
of the men were becoming frightened by the wild tales
they were hearing of the doings of the man-eating
jaguar. Would fright drive them back down the
river before their task was completed? He wished
Johnny was here. Then he would feel more free to
hunt that beast down. Must do it, anyway, very soon.</p>
<p>And what was Daego plotting up the river? He
could not bribe the Caribs. Would there be a fight
in the end? Well, if so, Daego would not find them
unprepared. He was training his men in a new form
of warfare. They were handy with their long-bladed
machetes, very handy indeed. Daego should see!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>He glanced about him. It was strange that he
should be in such a place at such a time. Yet he
wanted to know, to be sure. If things were as he
thought, he&rsquo;d make Daego no end of trouble. He&rsquo;d
trap one of those black shadows of his, show him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trap one,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;but how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a puzzler. Moments of reflection, and
then an inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing! Rivers have been blocked
against war boats by chains. This is better than
chains; it floats. It&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His whisper broke short off. Someone was coming.
They carried a lantern. He had not thought of
a light. What if they should catch sight of him.
Shuddering, he shrank farther into the bushes. Just
then he caught sight of the foremost man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daego!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Daego himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he listened he crowded farther and farther back
among the palm leaves. He was hearing voices, many
voices. They were talking in Spanish. He did not
understand Spanish. It was not what they said that
increased his fright, but the numbers of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must be twelve or fifteen of them,&rdquo; he thought
with a shudder. &ldquo;What they won&rsquo;t do to me if one
of them chances to spy me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By great good fortune the leader, Daego, passed
without looking to right or left. With him passed
the bright light and much of the danger of detection.
Pant watched the passing line with increasing interest.
The men following Daego went in pairs, one before
and one behind. Suspended on long poles between
each pair was a square, black box which, from the
bending of the poles and the labored tread of the men,
would appear to be heavy.</p>
<p>For a moment the boy&rsquo;s imagination played tricks
on him. These men were ghosts of the pirates and
buccaneers who inhabited these waters a century or
more ago. The heavy black boxes were filled with
doubloons and pieces of eight.</p>
<p>Then with a mental jerk he brought himself back
to reality. These men were men of to-day. The boxes
they carried were indeed treasure chests, but chests
of power, not of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Batteries,&rdquo; Pant murmured. &ldquo;There is no need
to go farther. I see it all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>And so he did. The long, black pit-pans near the
river&rsquo;s mouth were only waiting these black boxes to
give them the power to steal silently up the river. They
were electrically driven. The stationary engine back
there was connected to an electric generator. By day
it was at work charging batteries. By night these
batteries were busy driving the long black shadows
with their burdens up the river. What sort of freight
did they carry? That he could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to trap them to find out,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>As it happened, he found out before he trapped
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />FORGOTTEN TRIBES</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson and Jean found it strangely
fascinating to be marching straight on over the beaten
trail that led to the great unknown. It was exciting,
entrancing, this sharing a secret which had not been
so much as whispered by either of them, yet the
glances and curious smiles which the girl bestowed
upon him told Johnny plainer than words that she
knew; moreover, that she knew he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But pshaw!&rdquo; he told himself with a sudden shake
as if to waken himself from a dream. &ldquo;There may
be nothing to it, probably isn&rsquo;t. There probably are
many hard-beaten trails leading away into this wilderness.
Why should this particular one lead to the
home of a wild Maya? Probably end in scattered settlements
of Mexicans in some camp. It may end&mdash;&rdquo;
he caught his breath, &ldquo;we may have gone in a circle.
It may end in Daego&rsquo;s camp. Pretty mess if it does!
Have to be careful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>So, beneath the flickering lights and drifting shadows
of palms, over ridges, through low depressions
where there were no streams, now frightening droves
of small wild pigs from their sleep and now sending
flocks of brilliant colored cockatoos fluttering away
into the bush, they traveled on. There were more
pools now. By noon they had passed three. The air
was cooler. They were ascending to higher altitudes.
Johnny took long, deep breaths and thought how like
it was to the air of the Cumberlands in Kentucky.
Now and again, through the palm leaves, he caught
glimpses of distant scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mountains over there to the left,&rdquo; he said to Jean.
&ldquo;Looks two or three thousand feet high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the girl stopped suddenly in the trail
(the others had gone on before), &ldquo;where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Do you?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face was
sober.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go back?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o. But I feel sort of shivery. It&rsquo;s so
strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. But then, all life is strange, and
death is strangest of all. Besides, I guess we&rsquo;re doing
the logical thing. We&rsquo;re lost in the wilderness.
What do men do when they&rsquo;re lost? Find the nearest
human being and ask the way home. That&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;re doing. And from the signs, I&rsquo;d say we
were almost there. I saw fresh prints of bare feet
beside the last pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I. And Johnny, look!&rdquo; she held up a
short string of small, round beads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green,&rdquo; he said with a low exclamation. &ldquo;Green
jade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he seemed to hear Hardgrave running on
in a low, melodious tone so suggestive of great secrets:
&ldquo;Three gods; a black one, a green one and
one of pure gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Green&mdash;green jade,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, to be sure. The green god would be carved
from jade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the girl he said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rare find. Ever
see any like it before?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go on. Ought not to get separated
from the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they hurried on, Johnny heard a slight movement
among the palms to the right of him and for a
second, above the tallest leaf, there flashed a gleaming
blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did&mdash;did you see it?&rdquo; the girl asked, gripping
his arm.</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spear point, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; He spoke as calmly as
he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I am beginning to be afraid,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use being afraid now. We&rsquo;ve gone too far.
Walk straight on as if you had seen nothing. We&rsquo;ll
see more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did. It was uncanny, unnerving in the extreme.
There came a gleam from a bush and a brown
face appeared, to vanish instantly. Then there came
a rustle and a low call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s spooky,&rdquo; whispered the girl, keeping close
to Johnny&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>He wondered how the affair would end. Who
were these people? Were they really wild Mayas?
He thought of their own weapons. Few enough they
were. He was carrying Roderick&rsquo;s light rifle and
there was some extra ammunition strapped in his pack.
A good machete hung at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we against so many? There must
be no fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet there was to be a fight, such a strange one as
he could not have dreamed of, and that right soon.</p>
<p>As they rounded a turn in the trail, a sudden,
piercing scream rent the air. The next moment a
beautiful Indian girl dressed in a strange garment of
scarlet, with her hair streaming behind her, came
racing wildly down the trail and behind her, in mad
pursuit, came the strangest creature it had ever been
Johnny&rsquo;s lot to behold.</p>
<p>As heavy as an ox, but shorter of leg and broader
of back, the creature had such a face as an elephant
might present had he been robbed of half his trunk.
Rage gleamed from his small, black eyes. From his
side there protruded the shaft of a spear and this,
no doubt, was the cause of his sudden anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>To be snatched from the silence of the jungle to
the sudden strain of action is like being dragged from
the deep dark of midnight to the glaring light of day.
For a second Johnny stood petrified. Then, born as
he was for action, and trained for it, too, he sprang
forward. The shoulder straps of his pack were
thrown off and the pack struck the trail with a thump.
Then, like an ancient warrior, Johnny lifted the light
rifle and prepared to stand his ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; screamed Jean. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mountain
cow, a tapir. He&rsquo;s mad with pain. He&mdash;he&rsquo;ll trample
you to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one hand Johnny pushed her into the brush;
with the other he steadied his rifle. Down the trail
came Indian girl and tapir.</p>
<p>The tapir was gaining, and so in line with the girl
that Johnny could not fire. Now he was four yards
behind, now three, now two. And now, with a terrifying
scream, the Indian girl tripped and fell.</p>
<p>For a second it seemed that nothing could save
her. By great good fortune she rolled over once. This
brought her to the side of the beaten path. The tapir,
too near to halt or swerve, flew on by.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Not to be thwarted, as if realizing that here at his
feet lay the darling of the tribesmen who had sent
the spear into his side, he stopped short with a mad
snort to whirl about and renew his attack.</p>
<p>This was Johnny&rsquo;s chance. He now had a broadside
shot and could reach the heart. The rifle was
a light one, far too light to be used on such game unless
the bullet found a vulnerable spot.</p>
<p>The end of the Indian girl must soon have come, had
not Johnny, taking quick, but sure aim, pressed the
trigger and sent a small but paralyzing bullet into the
heart of the maddened beast.</p>
<p>It was a dramatic moment. For a moment the
tapir stood swaying backward and forward, then
plunged headlong into the bush, twitched convulsively
for a few seconds and then lay quite still. He was
stone dead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Hardly had the tapir fallen when Johnny was
treated to a sudden surprise. He was gripped tightly
about the knees. Looking down, he met a pair of
dark eyes looking into his. It was the Indian girl,
stammering words in her own tongue. Johnny understood
not one word of it, but knew well enough
that he was being called a brave one, a hero, a young
god. And, having read all this in her eyes, he did
not know whether to laugh or smile. He ended by
doing nothing at all until, finding himself surrounded
by a half hundred little brown men all armed with
bows and spears, and having become conscious of Jean
close beside him, he stooped, and lifting the brown
girl to her feet, placed her hand in the white girl&rsquo;s
as he murmured that word which everyone of whatever
land or tongue must understand by knowledge or
instinct:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; he said, simply and quietly.</p>
<p>There were tears in the brown girl&rsquo;s eyes, tears in
Jean&rsquo;s as well; yet they smiled through their tears.
Who can tell how strong was the bond of friendship
welded at that moment?</p>
<p>It would have been difficult for either Jean or
Johnny to tell how the movement started, but before
they realized what was happening, a line of march
formed along the trail. Before them were many
brown hunters with their weapons; in long procession
others followed, while close beside them was the Indian
girl. Just as the procession started, awe-struck
and silent, Roderick and the Carib woman materialized
from somewhere to join them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>A wild, weird chant was struck up, then all moved
slowly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange! How&mdash;how fascinating!&rdquo; whispered
Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a march of triumph,&rdquo; Johnny whispered
back.</p>
<p>In and out among the palms the procession wound.
There appeared to be no end to that trail. Whence
had come these people? Whither were they bound?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where are we?&rdquo; Johnny asked, an air of
mystery in his voice.</p>
<p>As if in answer to his query, a great brown shaft,
elaborately carved and gray with the moss of centuries,
reared itself up before them. Beyond this
they came at once into cleared spaces where were cornfields
and pastures with goats grazing in them. Beside
the trail were stone cottages with thatched roofs.
Beside these dwellings women sat weaving cloth on
narrow looms while others working over strange
stone bowls beat soaked corn into batter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wild Mayas,&rdquo; the girl whispered with a thrill
in her tone. &ldquo;We have found them! At last we have
found them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they have found us,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was solemn.
&ldquo;We are in their hands. This is their land.
When shall we leave it? Ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ev&mdash;ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps never. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />THE HIDDEN CITY</h2>
<p>It was strange, weird, fascinating, this march of
the Mayas. The rhythmic chant, the all but inaudible
pat-pat of their bare feet, the sighing wind in the
palms that waved like plumes above their heads, all
this stamped deep into the minds of the boy and the
girl impressions that time will never erase.</p>
<p>It was a march, a grand processional, but where
to? What was to be the end of it? Armed to the
teeth, these men had but a short half hour before
been following, surrounding them, perhaps planning
to kill them as intruders in their secret land. What
of the present? Was this a march done in their
honor? Was Johnny being thought of as a hero because
of having saved the life of that beautiful Indian
girl, and was this march given in his honor? Or was
it a ceremonial march which would end with their
being sacrificed to some gods, black, green or gold?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>As he pondered these questions, Johnny remembered
something he had read in Hardgrave&rsquo;s book,
something that had made his blood run cold. The
Mayas did offer sacrifices to their gods, or at least
they had in olden times. And now, as he recalled
it, he understood the presence of those pools along
the trail. The Maya country was a land without
streams. It was a limestone country. All the water
ran in underground grottos. From time to time one
of these grottos caved in, forming a pool. That was
the secret of the pools they had seen. Some of these
pools held more terrible secrets. Some of them were
thousands of years old. A party of scientists, coming
upon one of these in a territory that had been
abandoned by the Mayas, had found not only rich
treasure in ornaments of gold, silver, onyx and jade,
but human skulls as well. The lives of those whose
skulls lay hidden for so many years beneath the
water had been sacrificed to some god. What god?
The god of the rising sun? of the noon-day sun? of
the setting sun? of fire? of water? Who could tell.
There lay their skulls, mute testimony of the death
they had died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we, too, may die?&rdquo; Johnny whispered to
himself. &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Jean, knowing nothing of this, she was
enjoying the experience to its full. And why not?
Why dream of tragedy in the sunlight of a glorious
day?</p>
<p>The march came to a halt before a long, low building,
and at once an elderly man, dressed in an embroidered
cape which, with his dignified bearing, gave
him quite an air of distinction, came out to greet
them.</p>
<p>At once the beautiful Indian girl broke away from
the ranks of the warriors and began a long and excited
speech. Accompanied by many gestures and
many a nod of her head in the direction of the white
trio, this speech was impressive indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; asked Roderick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t understand Maya,&rdquo; smiled Johnny, &ldquo;but as
far as I can tell, she is Pocahontas and I&rsquo;m John
Smith. She is pleading for my life before the great
chief. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken there&rsquo;s a strong family
resemblance. She&rsquo;s his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleading for your life?&rdquo; exclaimed Jean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My life and yours perhaps,&rdquo; Johnny smiled.
&ldquo;These Mayas have a way of sacrificing folks to
their gods. Also I&rsquo;ve heard that white people are
not at all welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roderick,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;what sort of god
would you prefer to be sacrificed to&mdash;a black one, a
green one or one of pure gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roderick shuddered, but did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you are romancing!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not. Never was more in earnest in
my life. Men have disappeared into the jungle. Many
have never come back. Do you think all have perished
of hunger and fever? Not much. I read it
all in a book. Besides, Hardgrave has told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the girl&rsquo;s turn to shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the question more picturesquely,&rdquo; Johnny
said, turning to Jean. &ldquo;Would you prefer to be
sacrificed to the god of the rising sun, the noon-day
sun, or the setting sun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rising sun,&rdquo; she answered quickly. &ldquo;The
morning is so full of promise. Surely that would
be the god to choose if there really were such gods,
and one were to be sacrificed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>All this talk came to a sudden end as the chief,
stepping forward, took first the hand of the white
girl, then that of her companion. After that, nodding
to Roderick and the Mayas, he led them into his
house.</p>
<p>There, seated on mats, with a cool breeze floating
in from open windows, they were soon being served
to a refreshing drink and to food that was familiar,
but that seemed passing strange in these weird surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot tamales!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed as a great
mahogany tray of tamales was set before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm-m!&rdquo; murmured Jean as she tasted hers.
&ldquo;Wild turkey tamale. How delicious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They should understand the making of them,&rdquo;
said Johnny as he took a generous mouthful. &ldquo;Unless
I am mistaken the Mayas invented them. They
probably served them on plates of gold before Columbus
discovered America; yes, or even Solomon
found his mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how picturesque! How romantic!&rdquo; murmured
the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Johnny agreed with her, but in his mind many
questions were constantly bobbing up demanding an
answer.</p>
<p>That night as he lay alone on a comfortable bed
of mats with a heavy home woven blanket for protection
from the night chill of this higher altitude,
he thought of many things.</p>
<p>As he heard the steady pat-pat of a sentry&rsquo;s feet
as he paced before the door of that long, low house,
he realized that they were virtually prisoners. They
were being treated very well, and would be in the
future, he hoped. But would the Mayas allow them
to return home? He doubted it. The trails to this
hidden city of the wild Mayas&mdash;it was truly a city
and already Johnny had seen thousands of the little
brown people&mdash;were secret trails. How Roderick
had come to stumble upon the trail they had followed,
he could not tell. Well enough the native chief knew
that to allow these uninvited guests to depart was to
throw away the key to his castle and city.</p>
<p>What, then, would happen? Would they be detained
there indefinitely, be given the privilege of becoming
members of the tribe, of learning the secrets
of their ceremonies and initiated into hidden mysteries?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And in the end perhaps marry the princess,&rdquo;
Johnny chuckled. &ldquo;Grand little old fairy story, this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at this moment he felt the call
of the red lure as never before. As he closed his
eyes he could see great trees come crashing down,
see little tractors dragging massive logs through the
bush, see those logs splash into the water to form a
raft to at last go drifting silently down the river. This
was to have been his great venture. He was to have
tapped a primeval forest of priceless wood. That
wood was to have been brought to enrich the world.
The richest lady of the land might not disdain to have
her boudoir furnished with rich appointments made
from this wood. A king or president might be proud
to lay his most important documents upon its shiny
surface. There was to have come from this success,
riches, and a consciousness of fine achievement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I gave it up for what?&rdquo; he asked himself
soberly. &ldquo;For adventure, for the joy of discovery.
And for a pal, a golden-haired girl. The girl; I owe
all to her. She gave me back life when it was all
but gone. But I was not the only one who chose.
She chose as well. Together we chose adventure, discovery.
The lure of the unknown beckoned and we
came. If we escape will we win renown? Will they
say we have added a chapter to the world&rsquo;s golden
store of knowledge? Hardly. We are not great
scholars. We cannot bring back a detailed report;
don&rsquo;t know how. We can only say, &lsquo;we have been,
we have seen,&rsquo; and that is all. And yet, what adventure,
what lure of discovery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />PANT SETS A TRAP</h2>
<p>The evening following his trip down the river to
Daego&rsquo;s stationary engine, during the twilight hour
Pant might have been found in the largest bunk house
of the camp. A tropical wilderness seemed a queer
place for one to be teaching bayonet practice, yet that
was exactly what he was doing. He had learned
these tactics in a summer military camp. Now, with
five-foot mahogany clubs in lieu of guns and bayonets,
his Caribs were being taught to stab and fend, to
dodge and swing, and to perform all those tricks that
saved many a Yankee boy at Chateau Thierry and
Belleau Wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Why was he doing this? Had you asked him why,
he would perhaps have told you that Johnny had
asked him to do it before he went away. Johnny
would be coming back. He would expect to have it
done. Besides, the big battle was coming some of
these days, the fight to a finish with Daego&rsquo;s men. It
was well to be prepared in every way for that fight.
Daego&rsquo;s band still outnumbered them. He might get
further reinforcements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we could reduce their number somehow,&rdquo;
the boy sighed as, stepping from the bunk room into
the gathering darkness, he left his men to finish their
practice alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may do it, too,&rdquo; he chuckled, throwing a
glance toward the little shack which had been Johnny&rsquo;s
office, and from which at this moment there came
strange noises and a mysterious glow of light.</p>
<p>Hardgrave&rsquo;s laboratory, however, was not Pant&rsquo;s
destination. He was going much farther that night.</p>
<p>Recent reports of fresh ravages committed by the
man-eating jaguar had thrown his men into a panic.
One man had left camp. Others were threatening
to do so. Something must be done about it, and that
at once.</p>
<p>Lowering a mysterious burden into the bottom of
the dugout, and leaning a heavy rifle across it, Pant
paddled away down the creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Having located the end of the rough trail which
Johnny had cut to the foot of the bread-nut tree, he
bent down and began creeping cat-like through the
brush. Half way to the tree he stumbled and all but
fell. Like a flash he was on his feet and three yards
from the spot. Something moving beneath his feet
had caused him to stumble. His breath came quick.
Had he stepped on one of those great, poisonous
snakes that infest the tropical jungle? He would hazard
a flash of his pocket light.</p>
<p>For a second an oblong circle of light appeared on
the back trail, then the boy laughed a low laugh. An
armadillo, one of those strange, harmless, turtle-like
creatures, had lain asleep in the trail. It was this
he had stepped on, and not a snake.</p>
<p>Greatly relieved, he resumed his stealthy journey
down the trail. Some forty feet from the bread-nut
tree he paused to peer about him in the darkness.
Having found one of those low palms whose leaves,
three or four feet across, are quite solid save for their
ragged edges, he began silently slashing off leaves
until he had quite a pile. Some of these he spread
three or four deep on the damp earth. Then, lying
flat down, he drew others over him until he was almost
covered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t want an elephant to come down this
trail,&rdquo; he chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>A few moments later there sounded from that mass
of green palm leaves such a long-drawn-out whistle
as the little deer of these forests uses to call his
mate.</p>
<p>Pant was not hunting deer, but jaguars. In fact,
he was hunting one jaguar, the killer. Once in the
jungles of India he had used an exceedingly powerful
red light to frighten a tiger. Now, with the aid of
dry batteries from the power boat, he had arranged
a bright red light. He hoped with his deer call to
entice the killer to enter the trail, then to hold him
at bay with the red light until he had a fair shot at
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>It was, he knew right well, a hazardous undertaking.
Jaguars might not fear a red light. Who could
tell about that? The killer might scent him and,
turning hunter, leap upon him from the low boughs
of the black tamarind trees that grew near. This
he must risk. Pant had an interest in Johnny&rsquo;s quest
for the red lure. He had an interest in the Caribs.
He had a still wider interest in all humanity. If
all reports were true, if this great cat with the mark
above his eye had done the killing he was credited
with, he should be killed. Pant felt it his duty to
attempt this hard and dangerous task.</p>
<p>So his whistle sounded on through the night. Now
there was a movement off to the left. At once Pant
was all attention. At last he discovered that this noise
was caused by a large lizard hunting among decaying
vegetation for bugs.</p>
<p>Again the whistle. Again a movement, this time
among the branches of a tamarind tree. Pant&rsquo;s heart
beat loudly. Was the great cat above him? Was
he at this moment preparing for a spring? Could
the cat know that under those palm leaves was a
tempting supper?</p>
<p>But no, Pant caught the flap-flap of wings. &ldquo;An
owl or a parrot,&rdquo; he breathed in disgust.</p>
<p>But what was this? Before him in the path there
had come a sudden thump. Ah, this was it, the
very thing he had hoped for. The jaguar, in answer
to his call, had leaped to the ground in the very center
of the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>Now was the time to act. With trembling fingers
he adjusted his light, drew his rifle into position, then
threw on the catch.</p>
<p>At once a glare of red light, streaming down the
trail, brought out every leaf and twig with startling
clearness.</p>
<p>Imagine the boy&rsquo;s surprise at seeing not a crouching
jaguar with fiery eyes gleaming, but a small,
timid, short-horned deer, who blinked blindly at the
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Pant breathed. &ldquo;Call worked too well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But wait; what was this? There came a movement
from farther down the trail. Pant looked.
One look froze him cold. Behind the deer, tail lashing
madly, ready for a spring, was the killer.</p>
<p>As Pant saw, the deer saw, too. For ten seconds
the frightened creature hesitated. Beside him, to
right and left, was impenetrable bush; behind him a
jaguar, his mortal enemy; before him the great unknown,
the glare of red light. Ten seconds, and
then with a bound he was away; dashing straight at
the red light. And after him, in great swinging
leaps, came the terrible cat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>There are times when the drama of life moves
so rapidly that we can do little more than get out of
the way and let things pass. When Pant saw the
jaguar and the deer there was not even time for
that. The best he could do was to flatten himself
against his couch of leaves.</p>
<p>On they came. The deer decided to brave the terrifying
light. On came the deer and on came the
jaguar. Pant dared not breathe. Now they were
upon him. Then came the cutting dig of hoofs in
the boy&rsquo;s back, followed by a whirl of air.</p>
<p>What of the killer? Was that breath of air the
sign of his passing? Had he cleared the green heap
that was Pant, at a leap? Pant could not tell. For a
long time he dared not move. Even after he had
caught a distant splash which told that the deer had
taken to the water, he did not move at once.</p>
<p>At last, cautiously snapping off his light and gripping
his rifle, he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>He listened intently. There was no sound. He
tried to pierce the darkness but could see nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>At last, after throwing his lighting apparatus over
his shoulder and adjusting his rifle for a quick shot,
he made his way back over the trail to the boat. Even
here nothing moved. What had happened? Had
the killer followed the deer into the river? Had
he given up the trail to go prowling back into the
forest? One thing was certain; the hunt was ended
for that night. Pant&rsquo;s nerves were too unsteady to
give the red flash a second trial. Besides, he was not
at all sure it would work; in fact, he felt reasonably
certain it wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you yet,&rdquo; he said stoutly with the shake
of a clenched fist in the general direction of the jungle.
With that he took to his dugout and paddled home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE SPANISH GIRL REAPPEARS</h2>
<p>For three nights Pant had not visited Daego&rsquo;s
camp. Nor had he in all this time seen Johnny&rsquo;s
ghost walking out upon the air. That it had walked,
he felt quite sure. The night before, a large dugout,
loaded with the half-caste&rsquo;s men, had been seen to
go slipping down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just go gliding about up there in my dugout,&rdquo;
Pant told himself an hour after darkness set in.</p>
<p>He pushed his boat some distance up the river,
then, lying flat down in it, allowed it to drift downstream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might see that ghost again to-night,&rdquo; he said,
chuckling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>In this position it was impossible for him to see
perils ahead. A slanting snag caught his drifting
boat and set it tilting. Before he could realize what
was happening he found himself struggling in the
black waters.</p>
<p>Striking out with both hands, he made a grab
for the overturned boat. To his dismay he heard it
give forth a sucking sound, then saw it sink, prow
first, in ten feet of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darn!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Old dugout. Waterlogged.
What now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only one answer to this: shore as quickly
as possible. What if it were the enemy&rsquo;s shore?
There were alligators in these waters, great scaly
creatures ten feet long. He had heard one barking
not three rods from him but a moment before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here for the night,&rdquo; he groaned, as he reached
a leaning tree trunk and climbed upon it.</p>
<p>This seemed true enough. The tree grew at the
edge of a marsh. There were alligators in the marsh.
To travel that marsh in the dark was to court death.</p>
<p>Imagine his relief when, just as he had resigned
himself to this hard fate, he saw the dark form of
a canoe drift into the shadows.</p>
<p>So surprised and overjoyed was he that, casting
caution to the winds, he hailed the solitary boatman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>To his surprise, the answer that came back was in
the high-pitched notes of a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; came in the same girlish
voice as the canoe halted, twice its length from the
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant&mdash;Panther Eye,&rdquo; replied the boy, not knowing
what else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the boy&rsquo;s immense surprise, there was something
in the girl&rsquo;s tone that told plainer than words that
to her his name was not strange. More surprising
still was the manner in which, at sound of this name,
she threw all reserve aside and paddled quickly to
the tree and invited him to drop into the stern.</p>
<p>Once he was aboard, she sent her boat shooting
away across the river. Ignoring the entrance to the
river trail, she drove on down the river and entered
the creek, at last bringing her canoe up with a bump
at the entrance of the creek trail.</p>
<p>Pant remembered Johnny&rsquo;s story of the strange
Spanish girl who had visited their camp. Something
seemed to tell him that this was the same girl. He
did not have long to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>During all their journey the girl had remained
silent. Now she spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was here before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought so,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to speak to you, or your friend. You
had been deserted by your crew. We knew why. We&mdash;we
might have helped you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and I. What brought you up to the Rio
Hondo?&rdquo; the girl asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red lure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mahogany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that all?&rdquo; There was a searching note
in her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite all. Believe me, it is quite enough. Perhaps
you&rsquo;ve never felt the charm of it. Precious,
priceless, perfect wood&mdash;mahogany, the red lure.
That&rsquo;s Johnny&rsquo;s name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I, too, have felt it. I
told father that was all. He was not sure. My
friend,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice dropped to a whisper, &ldquo;I
have helped you a little to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little. You may be able to help us a great
deal, father and me. We&rsquo;re in trouble, not our trouble,
but our country&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she hesitated,
&ldquo;but I guess it&rsquo;s right I should. My father is deputy
for this territory. It is his duty to see that the
laws are obeyed. Someone is breaking our laws
and we cannot catch them. Not little things that do
not matter much, but big things that mean certain
death to many.&rdquo; She paused for a moment. To
their ears came the silent rush of water. There is
something dreadfully solemn about the rush of black
waters through the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These laws-breakers,&rdquo; the girl continued, &ldquo;are
smuggling two things to our people&mdash;rifles and rum.
You know what that means in Mexico. Rifles and
rum mean revolution; cruel, senseless revolution! The
Governor of the state of Quintanaroo is a good, kind
man. Revolution could never bring a better government.
But the people are simple-minded. Rum maddens
their hearts. Rifles make them want to fight.
Someone is selling them both at a great price, and we
cannot catch them. One man is suspected, and that
one is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Daego?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daego. But we can prove nothing. Every
motor boat is searched, but each one brings only food,
clothing and tools for his camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once, as Pant sat there listening to this girl,
so earnest, yet so young, so eager to help her people,
he realized that a Divine will, higher than his own,
had sent him here and that his greatest mission, a
moral mission, was just before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I can help you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I
know I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before his mind&rsquo;s eye a black shadow crept up
the river and in his memory there echoed still the
pop-pop of that stationary engine away in the bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a day, two days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come back
here day after to-morrow, two hours after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my friend, and may God prosper you!
We are your friends. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant stepped upon the shore and the canoe shot
silently away in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are your friends.&rdquo; How sweet were those
words spoken to a lonely boy in the heart of a wilderness!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />PANT SPRINGS THE TRAP</h2>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s conference with the girl at the creek landing
on the appointed night was short and to the point.
The girl&rsquo;s father was to station a company of his
men in a cluster of cocoanut palms at a certain point
on the river&rsquo;s brink an hour after dark on the following
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daego&rsquo;s pit-pans may not come that night,&rdquo; said
Pant. &ldquo;We have no means of telling. But we will
watch, one night, two, three if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a month,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father&rsquo;s men will be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, the trap will be set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, so much. And my father thanks
you. The best and truest of our people thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the girl vanished into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Next evening, just after nightfall, three strange
dories might have been seen stealing from the mouth
of the creek. Behind them, wriggling and twisting
with the ripple and flow of the water, came a serpent-like
affair hundreds of feet in length. The dories
came from the Carib sail boats. They were strongly
manned by Carib crews.</p>
<p>Leaving the creek, they moved slowly up the
river. When they had reached a point a mile above
the mouth of the creek, they turned their prows toward
shore. Once there, they tied the long trailer to
a Yamra tree.</p>
<p>This accomplished, they paddled rapidly back to
the spot where the other end of the trailer was bumping
the shore. Having attached this end solidly to
a group of overhanging trees, they returned again to
the other end. After unfastening this end, aided
by the current and their own sturdy rowing, they
brought this end to the opposite bank. There they
anchored it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The trap is set.&rdquo; Pant said this with a sigh of
relief. &ldquo;The night is ideal. No moon. Clouds drifting
over the stars. It will be very dark. If they
come, their very fear of light will be their undoing.&rdquo;
At that he ordered his men to row him back to the
other shore. There for some time he busied himself
with the fastenings of that end of the &ldquo;trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;A single stroke of the
axe, and it is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come very late at night if they come
at all,&rdquo; he told his men. &ldquo;Time for another thing.
Doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether I&rsquo;m here or not. The
trap will spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was eager to be away after the big cat whose
tracks, freshly made the night before, had been seen
in the mud of a small stream that crossed the trail to
the river. At realization that he was so near, the
Caribs had been thrown into panic. Some of them
had been for manning their crafts and drifting
down stream at once. But upon receiving Pant&rsquo;s promise
that within forty-eight hours the skin of the killer
should be drying against the wall of the cook shack,
they had gone back to work.</p>
<p>It was a rash promise, but Pant resolved that he
would make good. So this night, armed only with
his rifle and a common flashlight, he made his way
over the river trail to a place of hiding he had prepared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>He had covered half the distance, when on pausing
to listen, he caught the faint sound of footsteps
on the moss covered trail.</p>
<p>His heart skipped a beat. Someone was following!
Who could it be? Was it a curious Carib? Hardly.
They were too much afraid of the killer. Was it an
enemy from across the river? Such a thing was possible.</p>
<p>Stepping noiselessly to one side, Pant waited.
Straight on came the one who followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like two,&rdquo; Pant said to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated a moment. &ldquo;It
don&rsquo;t sound like&mdash;it sounds&mdash;yes, it is! It&rsquo;s old Rip
himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was. Rip, the burro, once a bag of
bones, now well fed on bread-nut hay, sleek and
fat, had chosen to follow his young master on his hunt
for a killer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, why did you follow?&rdquo; Pant said with a
chuckle. &ldquo;What am I to do with you? If I tie
you up here the killer may get you. I can&rsquo;t spare
time to take you back. I know what I&rsquo;ll do; I&rsquo;ll take
you along. We&rsquo;ll fight it out together with the big
cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this resolve Pant will always have cause to
be grateful; and yet, in a way, the affair was to end
rather sadly.</p>
<p>With the burro standing patiently beside him, he
had remained in hiding for a full half hour when,
without warning, there had appeared in the trail
not five yards before him the very creature he had
come to seek. There stood the killer!</p>
<p>So sudden was his appearance that Pant had little
time to prepare for the attack. He had only seized
his rifle and had no time to aim and fire, when, with
a scream that was blood-curdling, the big cat launched
himself through the air.</p>
<p>Expecting nothing so much as to be torn to bits
by the claws and fangs of the beast, the boy dropped
his rifle and threw himself back into the bushes. As
he did this, unconsciously his right hand reached for
his machete and drew it from its scabbard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Surprise followed. The death dealing compact of
the flying cat did not come. For an instant Pant&rsquo;s
senses reeled. Then, like a flash, it came to him.
The tiger had launched himself against the burro.
Feeling the machete in his grasp, without reasoning
as to the outcome, Pant sprang to battle.</p>
<p>It was well that he did. A strange thing had occurred.
As the tiger sprang, the burro had reared
upon his hind feet. In this way he had struck the
great cat squarely in the head with his sharp hoofs.
The blow had been a stunning one and as Pant entered
the battle he found the jaguar just returning
to consciousness. This task he never quite completed,
for Pant&rsquo;s machete, coming down with savage force,
all but severed his head from his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles you,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept my
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, overcome by nervous exhaustion, he settled
down upon the damp earth.</p>
<p>As strength slowly returned he thought of his
companion, the burro.</p>
<p>Creeping over to where he lay, he put a hand upon
him. Then he lifted the animal&rsquo;s head, to allow it to
drop limply back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neck broken,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Poor old fellow!
You could save my life, but in that fleeting second
you could not save your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, he gathered green leaves and covered the
faithful creature&rsquo;s body. Then, seizing the jaguar by
its hind legs, he prepared to drag it to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Guess this will satisfy
&rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the spot on the bank at which he had set his
strange river trap was not far away, he dragged his
burden in that direction.</p>
<p>Arrived at the spot, he turned the carcass of the
&ldquo;killer&rdquo; over to one of his Caribs. Having told
him to drag it into camp, he sat down beneath a
cocoanut tree that hung over the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here and see what happens,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There is no time so still as night on a tropical
river. Shut off by dense virgin forests from every
breath of air, damp, oppressive tropical heat seems
to place a blanket of silence over all. The great
river, with its sweep of waters, is as silent as the
stars in the heavens. The whole universe appears to
sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Pant felt all this as he sat there listening and watching
by the river. This was an eventful night. Would
they come? Would the trap serve the purpose for
which it was intended? So he questioned as the silence
hung over all.</p>
<p>Now that vast silence was broken by the bark of
an alligator. Did that mean that they were coming?</p>
<p>Of a sudden, as he waited, there rose out of the
silence a strange sound. Pant was all action at once.</p>
<p>With a look of mingled joy, determination and
anxiety on his face, Pant seized his axe and lifting it
high, severed at one blow the rope which held that
end of the long trailer that now spanned the river.
Instantly, caught by the current, the whole long streak
of brown swung toward midstream. Even as it did
so, between it and the other shore there appeared a
long black shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come! It will work!&rdquo; whispered Pant,
dropping on his knees to watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />CAPTURING A BLACK SHADOW</h2>
<p>The black shadow which Pant had seen making
its way up the river under cover of night, was a pit-pan,
electrically driven. In his conclusions regarding
this he had not been mistaken.</p>
<p>The thing which Pant had launched against the
black shadow was a log boom. It was in this very
boom that he hoped later to carry his 50,000 feet of
mahogany down the river to the sea. Now he had
set it to an unusual task. A log boom consists of a
hundred or more logs, ten inches in diameter and
twelve to twenty feet long, joined at the ends by steel
chains until the whole affair is several hundred feet
in length.</p>
<p>So dark was the night that the crew of the pit-pan
did not see the approaching string of logs until it
was right upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Of the five men on board, two, by the sudden compact,
were thrown into the river. It was with the utmost
difficulty that the remaining three were able to
prevent their unwieldy craft from capsizing. In the
end it swung about until it lay full length against the
log boom which, tugged at by the current, was rapidly
swinging toward the Mexican shore, where waited
ten officers of the law.</p>
<p>After giving way to wild burst of anger, the men
began tumbling chests of goods into the river.</p>
<p>Before this task was half completed, they were interrupted
by the occupants of a dugout, who, swinging
alongside, commanded them in the name of the law
to desist.</p>
<p>Pant was now sure that he had not been mistaken
in the mission of the black shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were on some lawful business why should
they pitch their goods into the river?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have them now. We are giving Daego
some of the trouble he so richly deserves. This night&rsquo;s
work will do much for Quintanaroo. But what won&rsquo;t
Daego do to us!&rdquo; he said, wrinkling his brow as he
pushed his dory from its place of hiding. &ldquo;He knows
well enough whose log boom that is. There is not
another on the river save his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time as he drove his dory across the
stream toward the spot where his boom was fastened,
the boy reflected upon the cost of doing the right
thing, the thing that in the end would result in the
most good to the greatest number. Surely one does
not engage in the battle for right without placing himself
in a place of great peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he exclaimed, strong-hearted at last,
&ldquo;as someone has said, one may trust God for the outcome.
The only question we need to ask, moment by
moment, is: &lsquo;This thing I do, is it right?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the end of the boom, he cut it away and
allowed it to drift toward the mouth of the creek
where his Caribs awaited it.</p>
<p>At the camp he found great excitement. The same
words were on every lip: &ldquo;The killer has been
taken! Pant is a great hunter. He has killed the
man-eater with a machete! Surely there was never
such a boy before!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>As for Pant, he divided his time between good-naturedly
disclaiming any bravery or skill on his part,
and mourning for his burro.</p>
<p>An hour passed. The Caribs settled down for the
night. Then Pant and his Carib captain sat beneath
their mosquito bar netting, with a candle between
them, talking low and earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The killer is dead,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open warfare has been declared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be a fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carib shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Who can
tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on,&rdquo; said Pant slowly, &ldquo;our men will
be divided into two companies; those who work and
those who watch, ready to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be wise,&rdquo; said the Carib.</p>
<p>At that they blew out the candle and went to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Next evening the Spanish girl&rsquo;s dugout was again
bumping the shore at the mouth of the creek trail.
Her father was with her this time. Pant showed
them down the trail to a palm-thatched cabin. There,
seated around a table of roughly hewn mahogany
slabs, they talked of the previous night&rsquo;s doings.</p>
<p>The deputy, a short, solid looking man, with small,
twinkling eyes, assured Pant that he was profoundly
grateful for the part he had played in the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were Daego&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;When
we had fished the two who went overboard out of the
water, we identified them, every one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not all,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Someone was careless.
On a case of ammunition we found the shipping
tag assigning it to Daego. So, the case is quite
complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Daego been arrested?&rdquo; asked Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Truth is, no one seems to know where he
is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he will be arrested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; the deputy spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Not arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a British subject. The relations between
Mexico and Honduras have not always been the best.
It would be a hazard. To arrest and try him would
be a danger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>For a moment Pant felt like repenting the action
he had thought of as being done for the good of all.
To risk one&rsquo;s happiness, perhaps one&rsquo;s very life, and
then to have nothing come of it, that was bitterness
indeed.</p>
<p>The deputy, having read the look on Pant&rsquo;s face,
was speaking again: &ldquo;Do not worry; your work was
not in vain. He shall be punished. And for one so
greedy as he, his punishment will be severe indeed.
His concessions shall be taken from him. Within
thirty days he must remove his wagons, his tractors,
his chicle kettles, everything that belongs to him. His
mahogany, which is at the river&rsquo;s bank, will be held
in bond by the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s chair, which had been tilted back, came
down with a thump. Concessions revoked! He had
not thought of that. Those concessions were so vast
in extent that his mind could scarcely take them in.
Someone had told him that Daego had made a quarter
of a million dollars the previous year on chicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is the price he pays for his paltry gains
from illicit traffic. Surely one pays heavily for the
steps that make him a law-breaker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the deputy, &ldquo;you are alone here
with this boy, Johnny Thompson, and your Caribs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Johnny&rsquo;s been away for some time.
But, trust me, he&rsquo;ll be back! He always comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you much money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little.&rdquo; Pant wondered what the deputy
was driving at now. &ldquo;But we represent a man who
is rich,&rdquo; he added as an afterthought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; the man breathed. &ldquo;And he is interested,
perhaps, in industrial development?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wishes to develop his mahogany interests
here. We came here to prove it can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. It can be done,&rdquo; the other said
decidedly. &ldquo;Much more can be done than that. His
tract, though very fine,&mdash;the very best,&mdash;is small.
Across the river, far up as you can go, we are rich
in forests, mahogany that has scarcely been touched;
sapodillas that will yield a million, two million pounds
of chicle a year. With chicle at fifty cents a pound
at the dock, that should yield a profit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our province needs developing. Our people need
the work and the pay that it brings. We have not the
capital. We have the forests.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a word,&rdquo;&mdash;the man leaned forward, his eyes
sparkling eagerly, &ldquo;in a word, if you two boys can
find us a man with money who is as honest as you,
and who has at heart the good of all people, as you
have, it will be possible for him to secure in Quintanaroo
concessions which in time will bring him as much
gold as Cortez hoped to win when he invaded Mexico.
The question is: have you the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Pant sat there silent, like one in a
trance. So sudden was this proposal, so vast the possibilities,
that his mind refused to grasp it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think we can find the man,&rdquo; he stammered
at last. &ldquo;You&mdash;you will give us time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Johnny were here!&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety, if you need it. Quintanaroo can wait
long; any land can afford to wait a long time for an
honest man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;I think we must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands solemnly with the boy. His daughter
gave Pant a friendly smile. Then they were away
over the trail to their boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Two hours later Pant might have been found still
sitting before his rough slab table, and still he appeared
to be in a trance.</p>
<p>He was fighting, fighting an impulse to run away,
to dash down the river in his motor boat and away
to the Belize radio to flash the tremendous news to a
man who had financed their little enterprise up Rio
Hondo.</p>
<p>Then, into his mind there came a picture in an old
book of fables; a picture of a dog standing on a
bridge over a river. In his mouth was a piece of
meat. In the river was a reflection of the meat
much larger than the meat itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog dropped the meat to snap at its reflection,
and lost all,&rdquo; Pant mused. &ldquo;I hope these concessions
are not mere reflections of possible wealth;
but I know that our fifty thousand feet of red mahogany
logs are not. To-morrow we must get out
another five thousand feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even at that, while he made his way to his bunk,
his heart all but failed him. He dreaded the fight
he was sure would come, the fight to a finish with
Daego&rsquo;s men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only Johnny were here!&rdquo; he again repeated.
&ldquo;Where can he be? That black man over in Daego&rsquo;s
camp said Daego had driven him into the jungle.
Surely no jungle can hold Johnny Thompson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this last he could not be sure. A Central American
jungle is an awesome and terrible place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I could tell him
the good news of Daego&rsquo;s undoing and of those wonderful
concessions that are all but within our grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if only he could lead in the fight that&rsquo;s sure
to come! Daego will fight. It will be a battle to
the bitter end. Some have gone down the river, but
there are plenty still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; he sighed at last. &ldquo;Johnny may not
be here, but his ghost is. He&rsquo;ll throw terror into the
hearts of those blacks yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night the ghost of the air did strange things;
very strange indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />CENTURY OLD CAVERNS</h2>
<p>Johnny was still in the land of the lost Mayas.
The city he and Jean had discovered was not the
city of Jean&rsquo;s dreams, the golden metropolis of long
ago, yet there were signs of past glory all about them.
Massive ruins that had once been a pyramid, elaborately
carved shafts reaching toward the sky, great
squares and slabs of stone, all told of the glory that
had departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think what it must have been!&rdquo; said Jean as,
on their third day among the Mayas, she sat high upon
a carved rock and allowed her eyes to roam over the
ruins of what must have been a majestic temple.
&ldquo;Just think what it was! Such a labyrinth of corridors!
Such chambers! Such secret recesses. One
might have been lost among them for hours!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>There was a rocky wall running along one side of
the city. This merely suggested a prison. But for
all that, it might as well have been a prison wall.
They were prisoners. They had learned this on the
second day. With the vision of the red lure burning
brightly in his eyes, Johnny had proposed that they
find the way over which they had come, and try following
it back. They had experienced little difficulty
in finding the trail, but once they came to the spot
where it entered the jungle, they had found it completely
blocked by grim little brown men. These
offered no violence, but neither would they move aside
and allow them to pass. They blocked the way and
shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders of the Chief,&rdquo; Roderick had said. &ldquo;I
expected that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So their first attempt at escape had failed.</p>
<p>Prisoners though they were, they had been given
the range of the city and the surrounding open spaces
where corn waved in the bright sun, where banana
plants reared themselves to the sky and cocoanut palms
waved long plumes in air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>No guests could have been treated more royally.
The best of food, wild turkey, deer, armadillo, the
best of meats, the finest of corn cakes, the most delicious
of fruits were served to them. At night they
lay upon beds that rivaled the couches of kings. For
all this, they were made to know that they were not
to leave the land of the Mayas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ever?&rdquo; said Jean with a wrinkled brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps never,&rdquo; Johnny said solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, we were mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. We were quite out of our heads
when we came here. But what&rsquo;s the fun of living if
you can&rsquo;t have some adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is joy in it!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl,
springing down from her perch on the carved rock.
&ldquo;And to-day, since we can&rsquo;t leave, we will discover
something wonderful in the midst of these ruins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did. Something came of it, too, I assure
you.</p>
<p>It was in the midst of an all but impenetrable
growth of palms and vines which, spreading over a
crumbling heap of ruins seemed to wish to hide a
secret, that they made the discovery, and having made
it, entered upon one of the strangest and weirdest
adventures any of them had ever known.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>As they crawled on hands and knees, here forcing
their way between the spreading leaves of a nut palm,
there tearing away a wild fig vine, they came at last
upon an opening. Before this opening sagged an old,
decayed door. There was scarcely room to crawl between
the heaps of rocks that blocked the way, but
once one was inside he found that he had entered a
damp, dark hallway that, extending far as his electric
torch would reach, suggested mystery and romance.</p>
<p>Johnny was the first to enter. Jean and Roderick
followed. There was a moment of hushed silence
as they stood there breathing silently as if listening
for voices that had long been stilled forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager the place hasn&rsquo;t been visited except
by bats since the year one,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>As if to prove that at least part of his prophecy
was true, there came a whirring of wings and one of
those great vampire bats, terror to all living things in
Central America, flew by so close that the current of
damp air stirred by his flight lifted their hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret corridor,&rdquo; Johnny said. There was a
solemn note of mystery in his voice. &ldquo;To what chambers
of treasure does it lead? We may yet be the
richest Mayas in all this little hidden kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;d take a broken sixpence for my share,
could I but return to my father&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo; said Roderick,
disconsolately.</p>
<p>However downcast her brother might be, Jean
was still game. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We
will find the god of the rising sun, the god of the
noonday sun and all the other gods with the gold and
jewels that enrich their chambers. We&rsquo;ll find the
chamber of the ancient princess. What shall we not
find. Come on. C&rsquo;mon! C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo; Seizing her
brother by the arm, she fairly dragged him down the
corridor which, to those who came from the hot dryness
of tropical day, seemed to possess the chill dampness
of perpetual night.</p>
<p>On tip-toe, lest perchance they might waken the
spirits of other centuries, they began their march
down the wide corridor. Only the diffident snap-snap
of great bats disturbed the silence of the place. Walking
in deep, age-old dust, they made no sound. So,
awed into silence, gripping one another by the arm,
they marched on until, having covered some two hundred
feet, they came to a sudden halt before what
appeared to be a solid stone wall. Certainly it was
stone, and it looked as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Jean exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end,&rdquo; muttered Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Roderick in a relieved tone, &ldquo;I hope
we may go back to the sunlight. I don&rsquo;t like these
beastly vampire bats. I&rsquo;ve been told they can kill an
ox by sucking his blood. They&rsquo;ve been known to
drive the entire population of a village from their
homes. What would you do if one of the bally rascals
made a grab at your throat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him by the ear and give a good sound scolding,&rdquo;
said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a bit,&rdquo; he said as Roderick started back,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began flashing his torch from floor to ceiling,
from corner to corner of the dungeon-like place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an opening,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Not a suggestion
of an&mdash;wait! How does it happen that this stone
at the end is fully a yard square, while all the rest
of the wall is made up of small rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a heavy cane which Roderick had insisted
upon bringing into the place, he struck the broad stone
a resounding blow. At once the place was alive with
echoes and whirring wings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds hollow,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He pressed the end of the stick against the top of
the stone and gave it a shove. To their surprise the
stone, which to all appearances was a door, dropped
slowly and noiselessly downward until it formed a
sort of threshold over which they who dared might
walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; Jean murmured.</p>
<p>As if expecting a million vampires to spring at
him from the dark, Roderick started back.</p>
<p>As soon as she could recover from her surprise
Jean set one small foot on the stone threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny, placing a restraining hand
upon her shoulder, &ldquo;let me go in and look about a
little. Not that I wish to be first, but it might&mdash;might
not be quite&mdash;quite safe. You are a girl. In a way,
I&rsquo;m your protector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I understand,&rdquo; said the girl as she favored
him with a smile that was altogether new to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>In spite of all his efforts at self-control, Johnny&rsquo;s
knees trembled a little as he stepped upon the rock.
It was strange to be moving forward alone into a
subterranean chamber which, to all appearances, had
not been visited for centuries. What would he discover
there? Was this the secret hiding place of
princes, a temple of worship or a dungeon prison?
What would he discover there; rare old furniture,
moulding to decay; gold, jewels, or only skeletons?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nothing,&rdquo; he told himself as he moved
forward.</p>
<p>After he had taken three steps he halted for a second.
There was something strange about the rock
upon which he stood. It appeared to have a greenish
cast, but being eager to discover the contents of the
chamber, he pressed on without investigating further.</p>
<p>The electric torch which he carried had an adjustment
which enabled one to throw about him a dim
light or a bright one. At the present time it shone
but dimly. As he attempted to flash it to full brilliancy
the catch stuck and the lamp continued to shine
but dimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Still impatient, he pressed forward down this more
deeply mysterious corridor, which appeared somewhat
broader and shorter, almost to its end before he discovered
anything of interest. Then of a sudden he
found himself all but upon some object which, sending
forth a dull yellow lustre, appeared to hang in air.
Most mysterious of all, from the center of this there
came a tiny but peculiarly brilliant light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he told himself, starting back. &ldquo;A
light burning through all these centuries! That would
be to discover the origin of light itself. That&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. His hand trembled so he could
scarcely hold the torch; his knees shook violently. The
room had suddenly blazed forth with an intense green
light. At the same time there came to his startled
ears a piercing scream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />TRAPPED</h2>
<p>The thing that had happened to Johnny Thompson
was absurdly simple; at least part of it was. Unconsciously,
as he moved forward in the dimly lighted
room, he had continued to fumble with the catch of
his flashlight. Suddenly, as he stood before the mysterious
thing of yellow glow and a tiny light, his torch
had flashed on in all its strength.</p>
<p>So much was very simple. The explanation of
the green glow was simple, too, once he read the secret
of it. But who had screamed, and why? That was
not so easy to answer.</p>
<p>The reason for the peculiar green glow was to be
found in the composition of the walls and ceiling of
the room. They were of a peculiar green which had
great reflective power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jade!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed after his first surprise
was over. &ldquo;Solid green jade. At least the walls are
set with jade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who had screamed? This was the problem which
concerned him most. To his utter astonishment, as
he flashed the light about he failed to at once discover
the entrance through which he had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turned around a bit,&rdquo; he told himself as coolly
as he could. &ldquo;Take a point and circle about until I
am looking at that point again. In that way I&rsquo;ll see
all the walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In choosing his starting point his eye fell upon the
thing of the yellow glow. He discovered at a glance
that this was not suspended in air as he had thought,
nor was there a miniature light burning in it. It was
a statue or an image of a god; a rather hideous god
with a hooked nose, a large stomach and hands on
which were fingers like an eagle&rsquo;s tallons. In one of
these hands rested a stone of some sort that reflected
light in a peculiarly brilliant manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold, and perhaps a huge diamond,&rdquo; Johnny speculated
in spite of his anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Then he began to make the circle of the walls with
his light. First the wall to the right of him was
slowly and carefully surveyed, then the wall which
had been to his back. No opening. His breath came
short and quick. A third side was covered. In his
agitation he set the light zig-zagging up and down.
Was he somehow trapped? Who had screamed?</p>
<p>Half the last wall was covered, two-thirds. The
suspense seemed unbearable. Then, with a sudden
sigh of relief, he started forward.</p>
<p>Before him was an opening. It did not seem quite
the same, but it must be the one. In his eagerness
and anxiety he fairly ran.</p>
<p>Now he was half way across the room, and now
at the wall. He was about to step forward and out
to freedom and friends when, to his astonishment, his
foot splashed down into water. It was with the utmost
difficulty that he avoided plunging head foremost
into a deep pool that lay just before him.</p>
<p>Once he had recovered from this shock he cast his
light over the pool only to discover that the back side
of the pool, which was some ten feet across, was solidly
walled in, as was the room itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Obeying some unknown instinct, he dropped upon
his knees and directed his powerful light straight down
into the pool. For a moment he gazed intently downward,
then started back in horror.</p>
<p>The thing he had seen almost made him faint. At
the bottom of that pool he had caught the gleam of
gold and the green light of jade ornaments, and in the
midst of these a horrible, grinning human skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he told himself after he had control of himself
again, &ldquo;is a sacrificial pool. The gold and jade
were a sacrifice. When? Who can tell? And the
owner of that head? The door is closed. I am
trapped. When will my time come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that very moment there came, faint and indistinct,
but unmistakable, the notes of a call:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t">Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t0">Whoo-hoo-hoo.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As in a dream he recalled the day they had practiced
that call, he and Jean, back there in the jungle.</p>
<p>Alert, straining his ears for the next note, telling
himself that when it came he would locate the singer
and thus begin the task of finding a way out, he
waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>A moment passed; another and yet another. The
silence became unbearable. He stamped his feet to
break the awful spell. Then he became conscious of
another sound&mdash;a slow tap-tap-tap-tap. Always a
second apart, never any louder, never coming more
softly, this mysterious tap-tap-tap in time became
more maddening than the silence. Still at strained attention
he waited for Jean&rsquo;s call which did not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; he murmured at
last. &ldquo;Can other ears than mine have heard that call
and silenced it, perhaps forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found himself filled with sudden anger, a raging
hate of the Mayas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What manner of treatment is this,&rdquo; he asked
himself, &ldquo;after I saved their princess from a terrible
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This anger lasted but for a moment. He next
found his mind filled with wonderings. In the deep
dust of the outer corridor there had been not a single
footprint. How could the living Mayas have set
such a trap as this without leaving traces of their coming
and going?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he reasoned. &ldquo;I have been
trapped by that ancient god, or at least by those who,
centuries ago, set him there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Again he listened, and again he caught that endless
tap-tap-tap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Water falling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began a careful search of the chambers. He
examined every nook and corner with elaborate care,
but aside from the pool, found not so much as a spot
of dampness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;the sound is unmistakable.
There is dripping water somewhere. Must
be within the walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he set himself listening for Jean&rsquo;s call.
A quarter of an hour, a half hour he waited and listened,
but it did not come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can have happened?&rdquo; he muttered at last.
Then he thought of the flashlight. The battery
was good for just so long, then would come complete
darkness. When would that be? He could not
tell. Shuddering, he muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might better be now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he threw off the catch. Sudden darkness
followed, but the after image remained. Sitting
on the damp floor, staring into the dark, he seemed
still to catch the greenish glow of the walls, the yellow
gleam of the god and the white flash of jewels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Have you never attempted to fall asleep while from
some distant spot there came with maddening regularity
the drip-drip-drip of water? If you have, then
perhaps you can share in a degree at least the feeling
of Johnny Thompson as he sat there alone, a prisoner
of other centuries, listening to that baffling sound
within the walls.</p>
<p>Yet, impossible as it may seem, he was able for
whole moments to forget the entire situation. In
those moments he saw again his camp on the Rio
Hondo. He talked with Pant and laughed with him
at his ridiculous donkey. He urged his Caribs on to
more splendid efforts, saw the piles of magnificent
timber, mahogany, the red lure, piling up, and counted
the days that must pass before they would send these
logs plunging in the river, fill their boom and go drifting
silently away.</p>
<p>Yes, there were blessed moments of relief; but
always the haunting darkness, the nerve-racking drip-drip
came pressing its way once more into his consciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>What was happening during all this time outside
the door that had so mysteriously closed? The scream
which Johnny had heard was Jean&rsquo;s. Anxious for his
safety, she had watched that hole in the wall from the
time he disappeared. The green flash of light which
appeared at the moment when his torch flashed on
had alarmed her; but this was nothing to the thing
she saw a moment later. Slowly, silently, as if impelled
by a powerful invisible force, the stone, which
for centuries had closed the opening, was slowly rising.
The opening was half closed before she could
recall her scattered senses. Then, without a thought
for her own safety, she sprang for the entrance. It
was Roderick who, with cooler judgment, had pulled
her back. Then it was that she gave forth that
piercing scream.</p>
<p>After the scream, white-faced and silent, she had
stood watching until with an almost inaudible thud
the massive rock dropped into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; Roderick said reassuringly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll push it open as Johnny did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Seizing the heavy walking stick, he pushed it
against the door just as Johnny had done. But, though
he heaved away at it with all his might, he did not
move it so much as a fraction of an inch. Nor did
the girl&rsquo;s slight, but frantic strength, added to his,
avail. The door was closed, closed and sealed for all
eternity so far as they could tell.</p>
<p>After many futile efforts they sank weakly down
upon a great flat rock, Roderick to sulk and to remind
Jean, as is a brother&rsquo;s right, that this whole
affair from the time they found Johnny in the hut
was a piece of foolishness. Jean sat in sad silence.
This silence did not last.</p>
<p>The picture of that morning in the jungle, the rocks,
the wild turkey, came back to her and she suddenly
remembered the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we agreed on a call we&rsquo;d use in case we
were lost from one another,&rdquo; she said to Roderick.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess that was meant for now. If he hears it
and locates us by the sound he may find a way to
open the door from the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing to her full height and directing her voice
against the unfeeling walls, she sang their call:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t">Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t0">Whoo-hoo-hoo.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>The echoes of that call had died away and she was
parting her lips for another when, of a sudden, her
brother seized her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist! Listen!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Faint, indistinct, but unmistakable, there came the
silent pit-pat of footsteps on the dust-padded corridor.
Jean&rsquo;s call had brought someone. But who?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />MAGIC POWER</h2>
<p>In strained silence the brother and sister stood
listening, waiting in the dark. Roderick had snapped
off the small pocket light which he carried.</p>
<p>The sounding footsteps in the distance became
hesitant, uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds as if the person, whoever he may be,
were a stranger to the place,&rdquo; whispered Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be? Place hasn&rsquo;t been visited
for hundreds of years. Look at the dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he followed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I wonder why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time after that they waited in breathless
silence. All the time the person, who now halted,
now moved a few steps forward, was coming closer
and closer. Who could it be? What did he want?
Did he know the secrets of this mysterious place, of
the magic door? He might. There was hope in
that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, switch on your light,&rdquo; Jean whispered impatiently.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? He&rsquo;s bound to find us
in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing the truth of this, Roderick snapped on
his light and sent its rays gleaming straight down the
corridor. As it fell full upon the face of the one who
had followed them there came a half-suppressed, shrill
cry of a child. It was none other than the daughter
of the great chief, the one whose life Johnny had
saved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wianda!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean, calling the girl&rsquo;s name
as she started forward to embrace her.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this name was the only word they
had in common.</p>
<p>For a moment the Indian girl&rsquo;s eyes roamed from
one to the other, then with a sudden gesture she held
up first three fingers, then only two, as much as to
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were three of you. Now there are but two.
Where is the other?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>For answer, Jean took up the heavy walking stick,
and after pointing at the stone door, made as if to
push it back.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in surprise. Then as
her face became thoughtful she backed away to sit
down upon the flat rock. There, for five minutes,
with head bent low, hands pressing her temples, she
sat perfectly still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thinking it out,&rdquo; whispered Roderick. &ldquo;I wonder
what she will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her fears for Johnny&rsquo;s safety, Jean felt
a certain great confidence in this child&rsquo;s ability to
solve the puzzle and set her hero free. Why not?
Was she not a native of the place? Did she not know
the secrets of the land?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she thought with a sinking heart,
&ldquo;why should she? She is little more than a child,
while the secrets of this place, if one is to judge by
the dust and crumbling decay of rocks, are old as
time itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the Indian girl leaped to her feet. With
a swift movement she crossed the corridor and pressed
her ear against the stone door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>As she stood there listening, across her face there
spread such a smile of joy as it had seldom been
Jean&rsquo;s privilege to see.</p>
<p>Then the Indian girl motioned for Jean to put her
ear against the stone door as she had done.</p>
<p>What she heard was a faint tick-tick-tick, or the
drip-drip-drip of water. She could not tell what it
was, the sound was so very faint.</p>
<p>Her heart beat wildly. What could it mean? Why
had the Indian girl become so suddenly joyous? Was
it a token, this ticking or dripping? Was it a sign
that all would be well? It was all very strange, all
so unreal that she found herself all but overcome.</p>
<p>On her wrist Jean wore a small watch. In her
idle hours she had amused herself by teaching the
Indian girl to tell the time of morning, noon or evening
by it. Now, to her astonishment, she found the
girl alternately pointing to the three o&rsquo;clock mark on
the dial, then away at the stone door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Jean. &ldquo;What can she
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably means that at three the door will open
of its own free will,&rdquo; said Roderick, who with his
usual skepticism placed little faith in the native girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starved,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of
this vile place and find something to eat. Thompson&rsquo;ll
get out of that hole some way. Leave it to him. Any
way, we can&rsquo;t help any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be sure of that,&rdquo; said Jean soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may leave if you wish. As for me, I will
stay here as long as this native girl does. I&rsquo;m not
going to be shamed by such a little brown one as
she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roderick sauntered sulkily up and down the corridor
for a moment, then sank down upon a rock
with a sigh.</p>
<p>As for the Indian girl, after listening once more
at the door, with the look of joyous satisfaction on
her face she sat down in composure to wait. Wait
for what? What was to happen in two hours? Jean
could not so much as guess. So, without trying, she
sat down beside the native girl.</p>
<p>To her surprise she found after a time that by
listening intently she could catch the faint tap-tap-tap.
It was weird, mysterious, fascinating, that steady continuous
sound that was so much like the ticking of a
clock, yet somehow so different.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;Can
it be that those ancient people held some secrets of
motion and power of which we know nothing? Does
that door, like the door to a bank vault, open and
close to a time schedule? And could it be working
after all these years?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how impossible!&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>The Indian girl heard the sound of her whisper
and, as if understanding the meaning of it, put a
hand upon her knee as much as to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things are possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Jean went on to assure herself, &ldquo;it
is impossible. Even were it all true, how could this
child know the secret of it all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment there flashed through her mind
things Johnny had told her about the ancient Maya
civilization, of their culture, their sculpture, their
architecture, their art expressed in the working of
precious metals and polishing of jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had mastered the art of writing, too,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;and had great libraries. Many of these
were destroyed, but some remain. Who knows but
these, their descendants, have read from these scrolls
the secrets of this strange underground cavern?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>So she reasoned, hoped and waited. A half hour
passed, an hour, an hour and a half. As the hour of
three approached even the skeptical Roderick grew
restless. He rose and paced the floor. Jean pulled
him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear the tap-tap when you are walking,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she exclaimed in an awed whisper. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s
stopped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a dramatic moment. The Indian girl
knew, too, for her face had suddenly become animated
with some great emotion. Gliding swiftly to the white
girl&rsquo;s side, she placed her fingers on her lips.</p>
<p>Instantly Jean read her meaning. She sprang to
her feet, and at once there came from her throat the
clear notes of their call:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t">Whoo-hoo-hoo,</p>
<p class="t0">Whoo-hoo-hoo.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Johnny Thompson, sitting alone in the dark, heard
and sprang to his feet. The next moment as the call
was repeated again and again, he found himself feeling
his way by following the sound closer and closer
to the singer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>Jean had kept up the call for three minutes when,
after holding up a hand for silence, the Indian girl
lifted the stout stick as if it were a fairy&rsquo;s wand and
pressed it against the top of the stone door.</p>
<p>Amazed, stupified, the brother and sister stared in
silence as the great rock began to fall back.</p>
<p>Back, back, back it moved until it lay flat upon
the floor. At that dramatic moment, smiling like a
fairy prince released from an enchanted prison,
Johnny stepped over the threshold, free.</p>
<p>Could Johnny be pardoned if he embraced his fair
deliverers? Well, he must be, for that is exactly
what he did, both of them, and the action seemed to
him a part of a beautiful ending to a horrible dream.</p>
<p>As they turned once more toward the rock that
was a door, they saw it was again rising slowly, and
with a silence that suggested great power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Johnny with a shudder. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. We must,&rdquo; said Jean, leading the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>As she glanced back from time to time, Jean saw
that Johnny walked as one who is lame, or who carries
a heavy burden on his hip. Being a person of
unusual judgment, she asked no questions. As they
left the outer opening and made their way through
the bush to the outer air, Johnny was rather longer
than the others in emerging. When he did appear
he had lost his limp. Again Jean read the signs, but
asked no questions.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />THE PASSING OF THE GHOST</h2>
<p>The night following the capture of Daego&rsquo;s pit-pans,
Johnny&rsquo;s ghost behaved very strangely. On
this night, as on many other nights, Pant crossed the
river to discover, if possible, some further details regarding
Daego&rsquo;s plans and to ascertain more accurately
the strength of his forces. Their quota of logs
would soon be filled. They must then make up their
raft within the boom. This must be towed down the
river. Would Daego, with his depleted forces, dare
attempt to take over the camp before that time came?
Once the logs were afloat, would he manage in some
way to break the boom? These were vital questions.</p>
<p>On this particular night Pant did not join Daego&rsquo;s
men. Instead, he hid in a low clump of palms; close
enough to catch the conversation of one small group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon ole ghost walks agin to-night?&rdquo; said one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yea, bo! He&rsquo;ll walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t&rsquo; no harm come to us, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all hain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; &rsquo;t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look ayonder. There it are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was the ghost. With his waving
gown all gleaming yellow with light, his shining
red eyes, his dark face and his lugubrious rattle accompanied
now and then by a piercing wail, Johnny&rsquo;s
ghost seemed more fearsome than before.</p>
<p>The chicleros grew suddenly silent. Even the sighing
palms ceased to sigh and the last scream of a parrot
died a sudden death.</p>
<p>It was an awesome moment. In that moment a
strange thing happened. Instead of hovering there
above the palms, the ghost began to rise. As he rose
the dull rattle, as of bones in a coffin, increased in
volume, and the wail, high-pitched and terrifying,
rose to a piercing scream.</p>
<p>Then, more terrible than all, as he rose higher and
higher, his red eyes grew dimmer, his glowing robes
melted into the floating clouds, his scream sounded
fainter and fainter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my Massa!&rdquo; groaned the black man who but
a moment before had professed little fear of the
ghost. &ldquo;Oh, my Massa!&rdquo; he wailed, rolling on the
ground in his agony of fear. &ldquo;Oh, my Massa, he&rsquo;s
gone! It&rsquo;s his last warnin&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s gone up. Now
death and disaster sure do come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in proof of this, there came from far in the
distance the dull roll of thunder.</p>
<p>As for Pant, he hastened to his dugout and paddled
rapidly across the river. His mind was in a
whirl. What had happened? He wanted to know,
needed to know, badly indeed. Not so badly, however,
but that he had time to pause and listen as the
dip-dip of paddles sounded over the hushed waters
of Rio Hondo. As he waited and watched black
streaks passed down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them,&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;That last trick
was best of all. Three boat loads. Must have carried
ten men each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he came near the cabin that had been Johnny&rsquo;s
office, and in which so many strange doings had come
off of late, he spied a dim light there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>On looking in he saw a single candle burning on a
work bench. Slumped down in a rude chair made of
packing boxes, was old Hardgrave.</p>
<p>At first the boy thought him asleep, but upon hearing
footsteps the old man stirred, then looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Pant,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s only
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then of a sudden, sitting straight up, as if recalling
bad news, he groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant, he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost&mdash;Johnny&rsquo;s ghost is gone. Left us tonight.
Left us cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant stared at the old man for a moment. &ldquo;Can
it be,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;that the mere mechanical
creation can seem to its creator to take on
real life and a personality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Hardgrave he said quietly: &ldquo;I saw him go.
It was weird, I can tell you. And I shouldn&rsquo;t take
his going too much to heart. Fully thirty of Daego&rsquo;s
men went down the river just now. This last was
too much for their superstitious minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty! Did you say thirty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fully that many.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Pant,&rdquo; the old man sprang to his feet.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em yet, Pant. We&rsquo;ll fight! We&rsquo;ll
fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we will,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />BLIND DRIFTING</h2>
<p>Late in the evening following his startling adventure
in the ancient Maya temple, Johnny tapped at
Jean&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Go get Rod and come
to my room. Got something to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later, in the privacy of Johnny&rsquo;s
room, lighted only by a flickering taper, the brother
and sister stood before a mysterious something which
stood upon a stool and was covered by a cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed as he lifted the cloth.</p>
<p>They started back in surprise and wonder. Made
of pure gold, with a jewel gleaming from his hand,
the Maya god, an awesome creation, stood before
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Determined that his adventure in the temple, which
had come so near being a tragedy, should not be without
its reward, Johnny had dared to take the god
from the place of its long concealment. He had succeeded
in bringing it from the corridor to the bush
where he had hidden it until he could smuggle it safely
through the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said in an awed whisper, &ldquo;is the only ancient
Maya god ever discovered; he is the god of
the rising sun. There are no such gods in the museums
of the world. This one, aside from the gold
and the jewel which seems to be a roughly cut diamond,
is priceless as a curio and as an example of ancient
art. And that,&rdquo; he exclaimed as he wrapped
the cloth about it and hid it in a dark corner, &ldquo;makes
me all the more anxious to get away from this hidden
city of wild people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not thinking of taking the thing with
you!&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we shall!&rdquo; Jean looked at her brother
in utter disgust. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo; exclaimed Roderick. &ldquo;I think it will
get us into a great deal of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble? Who cares for trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to the chief the first thing in the
morning,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to tell him or his
daughter, by maps and signs, all about my camp on Rio
Hondo and the urgent need of my getting back there.
The princess likes us. She&rsquo;ll do anything she can for
us. Somehow we must escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>To be drifting down a strange tropical stream at
night is enchanting, haunting, and mysterious enough;
but to be drifting down that same stream with your
eyes so completely blindfolded that you only know
it is night because you have been told so, surely this
is the most mysterious of all.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson, Jean and Roderick were passing
through just such an experience. For hours,
many hours, seeing nothing, now led by the hand, now
drifting in a dugout, they had traveled. Where were
they going? Home? Going to some more remote
corner of the Central American jungle where there
was no danger of their being discovered?</p>
<p>Not one of the three could so much as guess. They
only knew they were going somewhere and were on
their way. Such a strange way, too; over paths that
were so overhung with vines and palm leaves that
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
they must be constantly dodging to avoid them; now
on a small stream where the danger of being caught
by vines and dragged overboard was still greater, and
now out upon a wider stream where from time to
time a sudden burst of sunlight warmed their faces,
they traveled on and on. For Johnny especially,
the short portages made on foot were extremely difficult,
for always he carried his pack on his back. He
dared not trust it to another. In its very center was
the golden god of the rising sun.</p>
<p>It had turned out strangely, his resolve to have it
out with the old chief about allowing them to return
to the Rio Hondo. First, by the aid of many small
sticks and stones and a tiny artificial stream, he pictured
to the young princess his coming up Rio Hondo
in search of mahogany, his early success, defeat, a
second venture, the treachery of Daego, the probable
condition of his camp at the present moment and the
need for his speedy return.</p>
<p>He had watched with much concern the face of
the chief as his daughter presented the cause to him.
That she was telling much, perhaps a great deal too
much, he guessed from the changing expression on the
old man&rsquo;s face. A frown was replaced by a smile.
This was followed by a look of surprise, if not of
consternation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not telling about Rio Hondo,&rdquo; Johnny had
whispered. &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday. The hidden corridor,&rdquo; Jean had
whispered back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly it!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>At once he regretted having entrusted the girl with
his mission. &ldquo;If she tells too much she may get us
into greater trouble,&rdquo; he whispered to Jean, and at
that moment he thought of the golden god.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he whispered to Jean, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mine by
right of finding. These people did not build this
ruined temple, nor did they make or inherit the god.
It&rsquo;s been lost for centuries. Can&rsquo;t tell about their
queer ideas and customs, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had that plea of the princess gotten them into
trouble, or was it getting them out? This was the
question which Johnny asked himself over and over
as they drifted, blindfolded, down that river in the
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>It was strange, fascinating, weird, this eternal drifting,
drifting, drifting on into the night. Now the sudden
brush of a palm leaf told him they were traveling
close to the bank; now a mad forward plunge followed
by low exclamations, told of rapids; and now the
distant bark of a dog somewhere on land suggested
a cabin and some few scattered inhabitants.</p>
<p>They were quite a goodly company, this Maya band
which escorted him from their city to some unknown
destination. Johnny, with his white companions, rode
in a large pit-pan. There were other crafts. From
time to time he caught the sound of their dipping paddles,
heard their low cries of warning as one boat came
perilously near another. Twice they had made camp.
At such times as this, blindfolded though he was,
Johnny was able to estimate the number of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a hundred,&rdquo; he had said to Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a band,&rdquo; she had agreed. &ldquo;Wonder why
so many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess was with them. He heard her voice
from time to time. The old chief, too, perhaps. He
could not be sure of that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Wondering dreamily how it all would end, and
wishing with all his heart that Jean at least was out
of it all, he fell into a doze.</p>
<p>From this he was awakened by a sudden movement
of the boat. It was as if the hand of a giant had
seized the prow and suddenly turned it through a
quarter of a circle, then had given it a powerful shove.</p>
<p>For a second the boy&rsquo;s head whirled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what has happened?&rdquo; Jean whispered.</p>
<p>Johnny chuckled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a larger river, much
larger. In fact, it is a great river, and something
tells me&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; his words came swift and eager now,
&ldquo;that it is the good old Rio Hondo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, it can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be, and is!&rdquo; said Johnny emphatically.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t ridden that old river for nothing. She
has a way of teasing and tossing your dugout while
she whirls it forward that no other river ever had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added with another chuckle, &ldquo;I can
smell the water. It actually <i>smells</i> black.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the girl exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like thunder,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was thunder, the forerunner of a storm. It was
not a local storm, either, but one of those wide sweeping
storms that tear at the timber on all the headwaters
of a great river. Pant, at the edge of his
camp, where he was assisting in shooting the last of
the mahogany logs into their boom, heard it and his
face grew thoughtful.</p>
<p>The hour of great suspense came at last. Their
boom was loaded. They were ready to go down the
river. Daego had not yet led his men to the attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get away in the darkness,&rdquo; Pant said to his
Carib foreman, fairly dancing about in his eagerness
to be away. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give old Daego the slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tivoli&rsquo;s only reply was a sweep of the hand toward
the blackening sky. As if in answer to his signal,
there came crashing down upon them one of those
sudden storms that are known only in the tropics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get away under cover of the storm,&rdquo; said
Pant. &ldquo;That will be better still.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t now these tropical storms,&rdquo; said
Tivoli. &ldquo;All night in the rain fifteen men must work;
fifteen men must rest, sleep beneath canvas in hammocks.
Even with fifteen men we may not save the
raft, tied up right here. You do not know the tropics.
There will be water in the river, water in the sky.
Which is river? Which is sky? You cannot tell.
The river will rise like a tide. There will come down
snags, great trees, palm trees, mahogany, yamra, black
tamarind, santa maria, many, many snags. All night
long, at the edge of the raft, we must fight these
snags away. There will be no sleep for Tivoli tonight,
and perhaps no logs for Mr. Johnny Thompson
after that, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tivoli was right. Such a storm as this was! Nothing
of the kind had ever been witnessed by the boys
before. Flash after flash of lightning, water in sheets,
in streams, great avalanches of water that one could
all but swim through. Rolling thunder vied with the
increasing roar of black waters. And after that came
the snags! And how those Caribs did work!</p>
<p>All night, till the clock hand stood at three, they
labored. Then the water began to subside.</p>
<p>Then, exhausted, they threw themselves upon the
bare logs and slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At dawn we are away,&rdquo; muttered Tivoli.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>All that night, regardless of the lightning that set
the water all agleam, in spite of the deluge of rain
that fell, the Mayas and their blindfolded captives
drifted silently down that broad river which indeed
was Rio Hondo.</p>
<p>Awnings of cloth, cunningly treated with the juice
from the bark of the wild rubber tree, protected them
from the rain. They were safe and dry. The river
carried them onward. What more need they ask?</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At dawn, as a matchless sunrise painted the east
red and gold, there appeared above Pant&rsquo;s raft on the
broad river a black line, a line not of drift logs, but
dugouts, dories and pit-pans. Each craft was loaded
with men, and as the sun sent its rays shooting across
them they waved their hands and let forth a bloodcurdling
shout. In each uplifted hand there gleamed
a long bladed machete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come!&rdquo; said Tivoli in response to Pant&rsquo;s
call. &ldquo;Let them come. See that all the men are
wakened quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />THE BATTLE OF RIO HONDO</h2>
<p>The battle of Rio Hondo will probably never be
recorded on the printed pages of the history of Honduras
or Mexico, but to the last day of his life it
will remain indelibly stamped on Pant&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>As he caught the white gleam of machetes against
the morning sky, many searching questions invaded
his mind. He was about to engage in a battle that
might mean the death of some faithful Carib. Was
there yet an opportunity for parley, for compromise?
No! It was too late. Yet, in their previous actions
had there been blunders? Had he been too hasty?
Could the fight have been avoided? These questions
he could not fully answer; all he could say was that
he had believed himself to be acting for the good
of all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for compromise,&rdquo; he told himself stoutly,
&ldquo;there can be no compromise with evil. This man
Daego hesitates at nothing that he may gain a little
more wealth, wealth for which he has no need. The
men we must fight have sold their souls to him.&rdquo;
Having thus put himself at peace with his own mind,
he set calmly about the task of posting his men.</p>
<p>The purpose of the raiders was to break up his raft.
If they could but sever the encircling boom, his logs
would be set free, each to find its separate way to the
ocean. They would then be lost to him forever.</p>
<p>One anxious glance he cast toward the approaching
boats. One thing he feared most of all,&mdash;firearms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; Pant told himself, as no rifle
or pistol appeared in the uplifted hands. &ldquo;A fight
between crews is one thing; wholesale slaughter quite
another. The laws of Great Britain are strict, her
officers tireless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>His eyes gleamed with a touch of pride as he surveyed
his small army of defense. What stalwart fellows
they were! How their dark arms gleamed in
the sun! From the belt of each hung a machete.
These they had been ordered to use only as a last
resort. By the side of each, grounded like a rifle,
was a stout six-foot mahogany pike-pole. He had
taught them the last trick of offense and defense with
these weapons.</p>
<p>So they waited as on came the invading host. In
the hands of some he saw the white gleam of sapodilla
axe handles. With these axes they would attempt to
loosen a chain of the boom or chop a log of it in two.
Others balanced heavy sledges on the edge of their
boats. With these they hoped to sever the chains.
Their machetes were for defense. They waved them
to intimidate the Caribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so easily done,&rdquo; Pant smiled grimly as his
Caribs sent back a ringing cry of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let a man of them board us,&rdquo; was the last
word Pant passed along the line. &ldquo;If they gain a
footing on the raft we&rsquo;re lost. If one gets aboard,
double on him and pitch him overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the dark line advanced it spread out fan-shape;
then, with every wild-eyed Spaniard of them all splitting
his lungs in a savage yell, they shot their crafts
alongside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>With drawn machetes they leaped for the first mahogany
logs that lay against the boom. But what
was this? As they swung their machetes threateningly,
they received a rain of blows that sent many a
machete whirling through space to find its watery
grave beneath the black waters.</p>
<p>Against such an offensive they were not able to
stand. Seizing their paddles, they backed away to a
respectful distance, there to hold a council of war.</p>
<p>The result of this council Pant read as if it were
an open book. With machetes sheathed, but with
axes and sledges at hand, the enemy spread out to
advance upon the raft from every side. By this Pant
judged that they hoped to scatter his men and to effect
a break in the boom that would not only set his
logs free, but throw his Caribs into the river, there
to fight for their lives against pitching, grinding logs
and lurking alligators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>One move he had not anticipated became apparent
soon enough. The instant their boats touched, as
the Caribs rushed at them with their mahogany pikes,
the Spaniards who were not armed with sledges and
axes did their best to seize the pikes and wrest them
from the Caribs. In this, here and there, they were
successful, and always in the corner where this occurred,
the tide began to turn. It was one thing to
prod and beat a Spaniard; quite another to be prodden
and beaten by him. In the meantime, keen oars
flashed here and there. There came the disheartening
chop-chop of axes and the thud of sledges that told
that at any moment the boom might be broken, the
battle lost.</p>
<p>Heroic work was going on at every point. Outnumbered
almost two to one, the Caribs fought
valiantly. With their wild shouts forever on their
lips, they seized fresh pikes when one was lost and
fought with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>Tivoli, their chief, seemed everywhere at once. His
great strength served him well. Here, where a sledge
was battering dangerously at a chain, he made a
mighty thrust, swinging his pike sidewise at a Spaniard&rsquo;s
head. The sledge splashed into the water. Danger
at this point was at an end. Here an axe swung in
air to meet with Tivoli&rsquo;s well aimed pike and go spinning
through air to join the sledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>But for all this, the battle was going badly. Here
and there a chain was badly battered and in several
places a log of the boom was half cut through. Seeing
his men outnumbered where ten Spaniards crowded a
single dugout, Pant, whose slight strength had lost
him his pike at the very onset, seized a pike aimed
at his head and, gripping hard, executed a flying pole
vault right over the heads of the enemy and into the
booming waters.</p>
<p>The result was all that could be hoped for. The
Spaniard, who still clung to the pike, was dragged half
out of the dugout, whereupon that unstable craft
promptly capsized, pitching ten lusty attackers, axes,
sledges and all, into the river.</p>
<p>Tivoli, too, lost his pike. Angered at this victory
on the part of an enemy, he watched his chance and
when the Spaniard swung his pike to one side, with
bare hands and unarmed, Tivoli rushed at him and
rained such blows on his head as drove him to drop his
pike and leap into the river.</p>
<p>This much for scattered conflicts. Victory here
and there along the line; more than one Spaniard in
the river; but for all that, here and there the boom
was being dangerously weakened. The battle was
going badly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only a matter of time,&rdquo; thought Pant, as he
struggled back to the raft. &ldquo;A half hour; perhaps
less. Then our work is all undone!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Just as the storm came to an end and morning
broke, Johnny Thompson, still blindfolded and riding
among the Mayas, felt his boat swerve sharply to the
right and enter a small creek where overhanging
branches swept the awnings over the boats.</p>
<p>They had not gone far up this stream before their
boat bumped the bank and they were helped to disembark.</p>
<p>Imagine their surprise and joy when someone, very
short, very laughingly tugged away the cloths that
blinded them and permitted them for the first time in
two days to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed the princess, for it was she
who had unbound their eyes. &ldquo;See what a beautiful
world we have brought you to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed a beautiful world. All a-glitter with
raindrops flashing in the sun, palms and giant tropical
ferns had never seemed so lovely as now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>Birds sang their best. Even the screaming parrots,
that they might not be entirely out of harmony,
appeared to soften their discordant notes.</p>
<p>But into this symphony there crept a wildly disturbing
sound. Dim, indistinct, yet unmistakable,
there came the noise of battle.</p>
<p>At the first sound of it, Johnny Thompson glanced
wildly about him. Then, having sighted down the
creek a familiar bend in the river, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Daego. The battle is on! They are not a
mile from here. I must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the prow of a boat, he pushed it into the
stream, sprang in, seized a paddle, and would have
been away, single-handed, to enter the conflict.</p>
<p>They dragged him back. The old chief tried to
learn, from Johnny&rsquo;s wild flinging arms, what it was
all about. In the end he appeared to understand, for,
after instructing his men to look to their weapons, he
ordered them into their boats. Once more the Mayas,
a hundred strong, swept down the river, grim, silent,
determined.</p>
<p>So it happened that a second time that day Pant
saw the river above his raft lined with boats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Friends or enemies?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Let them
come. Without aid we lose. More of the enemy
cannot matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Daego&rsquo;s men, they watched the on-coming
fleet with consternation. Daego had no men up the
river. They knew that. Who, then, were these?</p>
<p>As the fleet came closer, a figure standing in the
prow of the foremost boat became plainly visible. He
was waving his arms and shouting wildly. It was
Johnny.</p>
<p>One of Daego&rsquo;s keen-eyed Spaniards was the first
to recognize him. With a wild cry of fear he dashed
for his pit-pan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the man who has died,&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;His ghost has been seen many times above the treetops.
Now he comes back. He is a ghost. Who are
these with him? They have gleaming spears. They,
too, are ghosts.&rdquo; So he thought, and prepared to
flee.</p>
<p>So thought they all. To a man they dropped oar,
maul, pike, pole or machete, and turned to flee.</p>
<p>When Johnny&rsquo;s boat bumped the raft there was
not a Spaniard within gunshot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>But what was this? As he turned about to look at
his companions in the boat he saw only Roderick and
Jean. By some skillful trick of boatmanship or
swimming, the Maya paddlers had left the boat. Now,
some distance away, the Maya princess was waving
them farewell as the remaining boats went speeding
back up the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how strange and ghost-like!&rdquo; murmured
Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing ghost-like about this,&rdquo; said Johnny, as
he patted his pack which held the rare Maya god.</p>
<p>The joyful reunion that followed was cut short
by the pressing business of getting the log boom
started down the river. The motor boat was brought
around, the Carib sail boats hitched on behind, and
they were away.</p>
<p>Hardgrave, who knew Jean&rsquo;s father and the location
of his camp, advised her and Roderick to go with
them down the river. This advice was not unwelcome,
especially to Johnny, who felt that he could
never see too much of the bonny Scotch girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>They had made their slow way down two-thirds of
the distance when a strange procession caught up
with and passed them. Motor boats, launches, flatboats,
and pit-pans moved by. Each was loaded to
capacity with the strangest cargoes. Here were four
tractors on a flat-boat; there many wheels that might
have belonged to cannons, but did belong to logging
wagons; here a pit-pan loaded high with great vats
and kettles that had once held the boiling sap of the
sapodilla tree. So they drifted by. It was like the
passing of a defeated army. And so it was. The
defeated king of the Black River was leaving the Rio
Hondo forever.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, with his treasure of red lure
safely piled at the waterfront in Belize, Johnny met
his millionaire friend, Roderick Grayson, at the dock
as a United Fruit steamer&rsquo;s launch came in. Three
days later, in Johnny&rsquo;s room at the hotel, Grayson
met the Governor of Quintanaroo and together they
drew up contracts which were to mean much, not only
to Quintanaroo and Grayson, but to Johnny and Pant
as well. In each contract it was agreed that Grayson&rsquo;s
company was to pay the boys a royalty, a wee bit
of a royalty on their entire output and, though the
percentage is small, the output is destined to be large,
and there is no reason to believe that the two boys
will lack for funds for travel and adventure in the
future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>The rare Maya god found its way to a museum in
London. The proceeds from its sale Johnny insisted
upon dividing with Jean. There was talk of spending
the whole of it in a visit to London and the Old
World by Jean and her family, accompanied by
Johnny and Pant.</p>
<p>At about this time, however, Johnny chanced to
wander down to the breakwater, where little boats
anchor, and there he met a strange seafaring man
who had a strange tale to tell. And right there began
one of the most unusual adventures that ever befell
Johnny Thompson. You will find it all written down
in our next book, &ldquo;Forbidden Cargoes&rdquo;.</p>
